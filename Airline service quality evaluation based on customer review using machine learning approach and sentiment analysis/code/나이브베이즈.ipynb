       " 'we first went to istanbul in a 4hr flight from malaga  we had lunch  which was good  then a boeing 777 to tokyo  they took care of the ambience so we didn t have so much jet lag  food came twice  and drinks were served several times  i recommend the home made lemonade  when going to tokyo we also enjoyed a typical turkish cake in the two flights  but when coming back to malaga we didn t  when coming back to instanbul  we were next to the catering area  where dishes were prepared  the cabin crew made some noise  so sleeping was a harder thing  i guess the best thing about the food in general is the variety of small things you have when you eat  and the worst thing is the fact that turkish really don t make a difference between breakfast and lunch dinner  for example  when going from narita to istanbul we had food twice  but before landing at 4 am  i guess it s better to have some small breakfast rather than dinner  remembering we had dinner like food before on that flight  i really missed the turkish pistachios when returning  the last thing to mention was the last cabin crew group  when going from istanbul to malaga  looked old  like the parents of those who took us to istanbul in the 777  i would have liked to be able to buy some turkish airlines merchandising on board  overall  we have to remember the good prices  turkish will continue being a good airline whenever they continue with that more or less good relation between quality and money',\n",
       " 'the flight was 30 minutes late on take off  the cabin crew english language skills were weak but they were helpful and friendly  the food was relatively good and seating was no worse than a typical virgin or ba flight  the real complaint was that the ife was very dated but as an overall package that avoids a stopover  you cannot fly to vietnam from the uk directly with anyone else  it was excellent value for money',\n",

       " 'long detour to get from gru to lax but gave me the chance to experience their j flagship product both in the international  b777 300  and domestic  a321  products  the individual reverse herringbone seats on the 777 are second to none  privacy and sleeping space are guaranteed  the entertainment is good enough and the flight crew professional and even friendly to some extent  the one downside was the food  which was not only below what one would expect for j and not very tasty either  in the transcon similar experience  the full lie flat in j is a nice touch  and even getting over the other passenger is not a problem at all  the only major difference was the crew  who were a bit more standoffish',\n",
       " 'i found the staff to be very friendly and helpful  the plane was very clean  had good entertainment options and the food was lovely  however i felt the layout of premium economy wasn t the best as there is only one toilet in premium which is located on the right hand side of the cabin  this meant every passenger on the left side who needed to use the rest room  which could be several times on a 14 hour flight  would have to cross the bulkhead seats  which is where i was sat  at the front of the cabin  if you plan to sleep do not select these seats as you will be knocked by passengers trying to cut across to use the rest room  i also felt cp have tried to fit too many seats in the bulkhead row of the middle section  i feel the end two seats impede the aisle from business class so when catering came through the curtain from business to premium there is a good chance your left leg might take a bump  three seats in this row would probably be a better option  the seats could have been a little comfier for the money paid  the only downfall on the entertainment was that it was a little light on choice  i ve traveled other airlines in premium economy and they had a healthier selection of films  overall i would travel with cathay pacific again but will probably spend the extra money to fly in business class',\n",

However for the very tall, could be issue. Flight fast lasting about an hour in both directions. Seated in 23F and 23A respectively. Good value flight for the duration.',\n",

Cabin crew went out of their way to make our flights enjoyable. The food and service was exceptional. Seating and beds in First Class were very comfortable. Unfortunately my bag did not make it on to the plane in London for our trip home but did arrive on the next flight. Although there is limited inflight entertainment options on offer when compared to Western airlines, the cabin service, food and overall value and experience more than make up for this. ',\n",

The legroom in economy was fantastic and very surprising. The crew were attentive and pleasant to deal with. The only issue was the lack of Indonesian style meals being available. Overall very happy.',\n",

Arrival cards and newspapers offered. 3 choices of main meal, followed by ice cream and Lindt chocolate towards arrival.  Flight attendants attentive throughout the flight. The New Zealand flights are operated by New Zealand flight staff and they do their job well. Bags out quickly at Auckland. ',\n",

While Spirit Airlines doesn't offer the inflight amenities that other airlines do, my flight was excellent. The flight boarded on time, went smoothly and arrived at my destination on top. Since I was tired, I appreciated the opportunity to rest and not be bothered. Others complain about the stringent rules Spirit Airlines has regarding carry-on luggage. My advice either pack light or follow the airline rules.\",\n",

Flight crew regularly updated us of the progress, and cabin crew offered soft drinks. Finally airborne almost 3hrs late. Amazing catering by DO&CO, crew kind and polite. Slept for few hours, seat was ok to sit or relax, to sleep it was a bit hard. Also temperature was rather high - woken up for breakfast which was delicious. We landed in Vienna about 2.5hr late. Would recommend Austrian Airlines.',\n",

Abu Dhabi ground staff are rude and airport is poorly run. The flight wasn't much better with rude staff. My headphones didn't work and the FA wouldn't give me a new pair. Food was mediocre and legroom was a better. Flight was filled was children that were running wildly through the cabin. Before landing, passengers were self serving themselves alcohol in the galley. Business Class was complaining but FAs didn't care.\",\n",

The service was great and the seats were very comfortable, especially on the brand new 747-800. The only negative point is the inattentive and rude ground staff at Fiumicino airport. Overall I would recommend Lufthansa on this route. The business class service is excellent, almost on par with that offered by Swiss.',\n",
       " 'Traveled DXB-MCT-LHR-MCT. I missed the first flight from DXB to MCT and was told that no seats were available on the next flight and therefore would not be able to fly MCT-LHR. The ground staff were extremely helpful and managed to get me on the next flight. MCT-LHR: The IFE was rich in content and the food delicious. The flight attendants were helpful. The aircraft and seats were comfortable. LHR-MCT was even better. Impressed with the ground crew at the check-in. My child was not feeling well and was crying very loudly, the 2 ladies did everything they could to help. ',\n",
       " 'Excellent comfort and food, which is served on demand during the flight. The seat converts into a flat bed at the press of a button. The seat and the pillow was ultra-comfortable. Passengers are given a set of pyjamas for red-eye flight and amenities from Giorgio Armani in a pouch. Service, however, can be improved as it is not consistent. I had to wave to get the attention of the flight attendant as no one had attended to me for more than 5 min after the attendant light was turned on. I also had to remind the flight steward to collect my glass prior to take-off. No one reminded me to stow away my tray table prior to landing.',\n",
       " \"Truly amazing. World's best airline for a reason. Great service, lots of extras provided, on time.\",\n",
       " \"I had a very good flight on Thai Airways' Economy Class from Bangkok to Phuket. Thai has a good website and app which I used to check-in, add my ticket to the Passbook app and chose my seat. Since I'm very tall the ground stewardess offered me an emergency row seat, which apparently are kept from online check-in, free of charge when I checked in my hold luggage. I thought this was a very nice gesture and am very thankful for it. The rest of the ground and cabin crew from Thai were also very professional, kind and helpful. The seat was comfortable and thanks to the kind ground stewardess I had all the leg room I needed. Food and drinks were good and tasty. I liked the coconut dessert and the fact that on a short flight there was another round of drinks after the meal. The downside to the emergency exit row was the fact that I didn't have my own entertainment screen. There was also no WiFi available. On this short flight I didn't miss either though. Thank you Thai Airways for this smooth flight!\",\n",
       " \"I flew with Thomson Airways on the 15th July and the 25th July 2015. Both aircrafts were Boeing 737-800 and both flights left on time. The seats were comfortable and you could sleep on very easily. They were very wide and the legroom was really good. The cabin crew were helpful and friendly and the food was very good. Prices for the food wasn't expensive and both planes were clean. The airports were well run and ground staff were good. \",\n",
       " 'Two flights to get us from Ankara to Athens. The first leg was to Istanbul. Online check-in worked and very fast service at Ankara airport. Boarding started 50 minutes before flight due to go which seemed early. Flight was supposed to be 45 minutes, revised to 52, and eventually took 80 as we went past Istanbul and then turned back. This left us with tight connection at Atat체rk. However we left half an hour late for no apparent reason. So overall too much time on the planes for such a short journey. Onboard service excellent though. In flight entertainment not turned on for first flight, but was for second.',\n",
       " \"We first went to Istanbul in a 4hr flight from Malaga. We had lunch, which was good. Then a Boeing 777 to Tokyo, they took care of the ambience so we didn't have so much jet lag, food came twice, and drinks were served several times. I recommend the home-made lemonade. When going to Tokyo we also enjoyed a typical Turkish cake in the two flights, but when coming back to Malaga we didn't. When coming back to Instanbul, we were next to the catering area, where dishes were prepared. The cabin crew made some noise, so sleeping was a harder thing. I guess the best thing about the food in general is the variety of small things you have when you eat, and the worst thing is the fact that Turkish really don't make a difference between breakfast and lunch/dinner. For example, when going from Narita to Istanbul we had food twice, but before landing at 4 am, I guess it's better to have some small breakfast rather than dinner, remembering we had dinner-like food before on that flight. I really missed the Turkish pistachios when returning. The last thing to mention was the last cabin crew group, when going from Istanbul to Malaga, looked old, like the parents of those who took us to Istanbul in the 777. I would have liked to be able to buy some Turkish Airlines merchandising on-board. Overall, we have to remember the good prices. Turkish will continue being a good airline whenever they continue with that more or less good relation between quality and money.\",\n",
       " 'The flight was 30 minutes late on take off. the cabin crew English language skills were weak but they were helpful and friendly. The food was relatively good and seating was no worse than a typical Virgin or BA flight. The real complaint was that the IFE was very dated but as an overall package that avoids a stopover (you cannot fly to Vietnam from the UK directly with anyone else) it was excellent value for money.',\n",
       " 'Legroom comfortable, cabin very quiet and LED lighting gives a great feel. Charging and USB socket on every seat very helpful. The crew were smiling and courteous, and food extremely good. Best service to date with Air India, except for the immigrations and customs in Delhi which could be done directly in Bangalore.',\n",
       " 'Long detour to get from GRU to LAX but gave me the chance to experience their J flagship product both in the international (B777-300) and domestic (A321) products. The individual reverse herringbone seats on the 777 are second to none. Privacy and sleeping space are guaranteed. The entertainment is good enough and the flight crew professional and even friendly to some extent. The one downside was the food, which was not only below what one would expect for J and not very tasty either. In the transcon similar experience. The full lie flat in J is a nice touch, and even getting over the other passenger is not a problem at all. The only major difference was the crew, who were a bit more standoffish.',\n",
       " \"I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The plane was very clean, had good entertainment options and the food was lovely. However I felt the layout of Premium Economy wasn't the best as there is only one toilet in Premium which is located on the right hand side of the cabin. This meant every passenger on the left side who needed to use the rest room (which could be several times on a 14 hour flight) would have to cross the bulkhead seats (which is where I was sat) at the front of the cabin. If you plan to sleep do not select these seats as you will be knocked by passengers trying to cut across to use the rest room. I also felt CP have tried to fit too many seats in the bulkhead row of the middle section. I feel the end two seats impede the aisle from business class so when catering came through the curtain from business to premium there is a good chance your left leg might take a bump. Three seats in this row would probably be a better option. The seats could have been a little comfier for the money paid. The only downfall on the entertainment was that it was a little light on choice, I've traveled other airlines in premium economy and they had a healthier selection of films. Overall I would travel with Cathay Pacific again but will probably spend the extra money to fly in business class.\",\n",
       " 'We had an early morning departure from Boseman Montana, we were a large family and we got a very helpful Delta Airlines check in staff. The flight in itself was nice, both legs were short but I was more comfortable with the older 757-200 seats from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas but they were quite similar, since they were both short flights. There was no meal service but a choice of pretzels or nuts or biscuits and the attendants were allowing us to have more than one thing. All bags came through without issue and on time.',\n",
       " \"The original reservation was SJC?밃TL?밄CN. Delta later modified my outbound flight and added a SEA stop between SJC and ATL, which added several hours to an already long trip, and this is the low point of my experience. SEA-ATL flight was delayed by 3 hours, and gate agents got us pizza and soft drinks, and alcohol was free during that delayed flight (delays happen, and these gate agents and FA's looked after us very well). Home-bound, ATL-SJC flight arrived 25 mins late. The other 3 flights were on time and uneventful. The check-in, gate, and onboard staff were friendly and efficient. I was surprised to be offered 3 choices for dinner on transatlantic flights, as well as a small mid-flight snack on BCN?밃TL flight in economy class. Flight attendants were present through the flight. Seat-back screens provided great options for individual entertainment. The extra leg-room, boarding priority, and premium drink, are well worth the cost of a Comfort+ seat. I wish seats were wider but this is true of every airline I've flown in economy class. Luggage arrived on time. I will recommend this airline for international flights. I'm a former frequent flyer of United and American airlines, who never handled their flight delays nearly as reasonably and promptly as Delta did.\",\n",
       " 'The flight was nice and comfortable, as always. The service was OK, not very entertaining, but it is actually not required for a short range flight. The service gave a moderate selection of food and beverages, and I personally recommend the Double Chocolate Muffin (very tasty). Being a low cost airline I very recommend to fly easyJet whenever possible.',\n",
       " \"Very good flight in Royal Laurel Class, EVA Air's Business Class product, with a herringbone 1-2-1 setup from Amsterdam to Bangkok. The excellent service started with the superb app and website, which you can use to check-in, add your ticket to the Passbook app, select your seat and meal from a large range of options and keep updated about flight changes. The gate changed, but the flight was on time. I was greeted by a friendly and professional cabin crew who provided sufficient and tasty food and beverages as well as hot towels, ear plugs, pyjamas and a nice EVA Air amenity kit from Rimowa and kept the cabin spot clean. The seat was comfortable with enough leg room and turned into a fully flat bed, it was also large enough to fit my long legs. I had a hard time sleeping because of some turbulence, but the artificial sky helped me get some good rest either way. The only thing that lacked on this flight was a WiFi connection that EVA Air has on some of their 777-300ERs but the Star Gallery, with a large selection of recent Western and Asian films and music, kept me entertained throughout the whole flight.\",\n",
       " 'I was impressed with both flights. The Edinburgh to Amsterdam leg was comfortable and the cabin crew extremely professional. The flight to Dammam was also excellent. The seating was comfortable and I had ample leg room. The food and inflight entertainment was great too.',\n",
       " 'Traveled from Stockholm to Munich in the originally booked slimline Economy seat, which surprisingly felt more roomy at a 30-inch pitch than the 31-to-33-inch Air Canada E190 Economy seat I sat in three days later. Complimentary sandwiches and beverages served en route. Effortless connection to onward flight to Canada on arrival in Munich. Received an unexpected upgrade to Business Class, which was a wonderful experience with more personalized service, good food, a decent selection of documentaries to watch (which I prefer to movies), and a comfortable recliner seat.',\n",
       " 'Frankfurt to Bangkok via Muscat and vice versa. Travelling as a family: 2 adults and 2 children. Excellent service on all legs of both trips. From check in to baggage claim I could not say one negative thing about this airline. They simply deliver: bring you to from A to B at a reasonable price, offering more legspace in economy than their competitors. Service level nothing to be ashamed of, flight attendants cater to all your needs and the food was good. In my opinion one of the most underrated airlines.',\n",
       " \"The new cabin looked nice and fresh. I had a middle seat in economy, which is normally a nightmare, but I could amazingly stretch my legs due to lots of legroom (I'm 1.85) and the inflight entertainment was top notch with large and sharp screens and a goid selection. Wifi available for a small sum and it worked really well throughout the flight. It was odd to be chatting with friends in the air but time passed quickly this way. Food was okay, you pay for drinks except at mealtime but free water, coffee, tea, which is all I drink anyway. The cabin crew were friendly, joking and having fun with passengers. Return flight on SAS Plus, nothing less than outstanding premium economy seating, great crew again.\",\n",
       " 'A very smooth flight! Pilots kept passengers updated with all information as to when they were going to take off/land and boarding updates. Furthermore, the flight attendants were extremely helpful and smiling. Superb food, average flight entertainment, seats were good. All in all, a very good airline.',\n",
       " 'Once again very pleasant experience flying with Westjet. Ground staff and flight staff kind and helpful. Flight from Winnipeg to Toronto was delayed for an hour and passengers were informed of the delay at all times. Clean aircraft, generous legroom and comfortable seats. ',\n",
       " 'My flight to Buenos Aires was not full, plenty of room to stretch. Flight to Miami was full because of school vacation, big mistake on my part. The A330 is uncomfortable in economy. When the seat in front of you is reclined, you have the tray table pitted against you stomach, even if you are not fat. The flight attendants should ask everyone to sit upright when serving meals on the A330. Rows are so close that it is impossible to get up from your seat normally. One must slide to the end and climb out. I have flown this aircraft before and they are all the same in Economy - horrible. Considering how packed the flight was, the flight attendants were excellent. The food was mediocre with two choices: pasta or beef, and very small servings. Flight attendants provided drinks generously and water service was available throughout the flight. Bathrooms were kept fairly clean. Movie selection was very good, free headphones were provided. A very uncomfortable aircraft, avoid the A330 Economy. Only seats that looked spacious were the exit row seats. Check-in at EZE was smooth despite crowds and airport chaos.',\n",
       " \"Got exactly what we paid for with AF. 45 mins late leaving ATL due to airport shutdown because of Thunderstorm. Seats OK, not great although better than Delta on the same route. Food OK, but took 2 hours from dep to start service-I always think AF should follow Delta's example here and start service on the late flights as soon as they can. IFE not the best. Service generally good, except for one minor complaint-you have to ask for water. Made up some time in air and arrived CDG 10 mins late. Luckily our connection to IST was in in the next terminal and we could fast track security, so our already short connection was comfortably made. CDG-IST about an hour late, but no reason given. I think the European business class is woeful in terms of seats. Basically economy seat with no middle passenger and no IFE for 3.5 hour flight. Apart from that everything was pretty much as expected\",\n",

Unfortunately western food was horrible, it seemed old, no taste - crew did not accept that I switch to Japanese menu. Wine list as poor as on the way to KIX.

Only juice and water were offered as a welcome drink, but a full range of beverages was available once underway. The seat was comfortable for a daytime flight, but there was not a lot of storage in-seat. The service was efficient but generally a bit distant. We were served a large lunch and a snack on the 8 hour flight, both fine. The flight operated on time and was a very good experience for the price.',\n",
       " 'Booked very late so paid a fortune but I had to travel. Other than this everything was good. Easy purchase and online check-in, boarding fine though a long wait in the warm sun which would have been grim in rain and cold. Flight on time, great UK flight deck and Italian cabin crew. Seats and legroom are ok for a 2.5 hour flight. Coffee pretty good. Arrived 20 mins early.',\n",
       " 'When I arrived at the airport I got into the check-in line although I had my printed boarding pass. Seeing other passengers approach a separate window that appeared to be there to sell tickets or collect overcharges, I approached, showed my passport and boarding pass and asked if I needed to remain in the check in queue. That is when she told me that because the flight was full, I would be allowed to check in my one rolling bag free of charge. After security, boarding of the flight was impressive in terms of smoothness and professionalism. There were two lines: priority for those who prepaid their seat and general for those who chose not to spend a few extra euros for excellent service and benefits. The priority line has seats for passengers but the general boarding did not. I was the first to board. I quickly found my aisle exit row seat and sat. The flight attendant walked by and asked that I store the hand bag I had with me in the overhead as it was an exit row. Priority boarding was relaxed and more civilized. Print boarding pass before you get to the airport. If you printed your boarding pass, you can go directly to the gate. I was able to check in my rolling bag for free because the flight was nearly full and there was need for overhead space. Weigh your hand luggae and ensure it is within the rules. Spend the money and reserve a priority seat. It makes a huge difference. ',\n",

Boarding the plane was quick and soon enough we were airborne. The A332 is roomy but the seats in business were tight and at times a bit uncomfortable. Without an air control, the temp got really sweaty and hot. Sleeping was rough! Food was sufficient but there was no prior cocktail service. Nothing was offered. After asking, the FA was cordial and served us the drinks of choice. Service was professional and exceptionally quick. Flight was safe and upon arriving on route to Rhodes, the lounge in Germany was a great place to get a rest and some complimentary breakfast, the lounge was better than AA's admiral's club at JFK. Dependable but nothing special for a business class service. Would rather fly American Business.\",\n",

Once airborne, the service was prompt and FA's generally friendly although a couple of them appeared to be annoyed and uninterested in their job. Dinner and breakfast were OK with reasonable number of meal and drink choices. The pods are at the end of their service life with cushions becoming inadequate for restful sleep. IFE content was mediocre and sound quality was poor. Due to the lengthy delay in Beijing, I missed my connection but the wonderfully polite and helpful agent who took my call at AC's Concierge Desk had me secured on the very last flight out and even had my boarding pass delivered to the arrival gate in Toronto. It is nice to see there are still some service-minded people left at AC. The flight from Toronto to Montreal had very basic service given the short duration and the time of day.

The flight was good, cabin crew were friendly, sometimes  absent in the cabin and not very happy when you asked them something.  The food was OK, not gastronomic but acceptable in an economy class. We had delays of 35 minutes by landing, so the flight were quite on time, though that the longest delay was due of an engine problem. I recommend British Airways even for short flights (if you book early and fares not too high) than for longer ones.

If you don't have a laptop, you are probably out of luck. Premium economy seats are empty, and are basically the same economy seats on SYD-PEK (channel-based IFE). ATC delayed 1.5 hours both directions. Overall a decent value for money, if you have China on your visit list and don't really mind about the IFE. Be aware of ATC delays if you only plan to transit.\",\n",
       " 'I flew from CDG to RUH. Flight was delayed one hour, service was excellent. Seats were old but comfortable, food was great and IFE was decent.',\n",
       " \"The positives: The Dreamliner is an excellent and new aircraft and for once everything on it worked and was clean and well maintained. The lie flat bed in business was excellent. Much more spacious than the United product or the Smartium business bed on Asiana and others. The layout of the seats is a bit different - less privacy but more open feeling and real space. Comfy duvet and blankets provided on this night flight. Cabin crew although older (55+) were very well trained, warm, polite and efficient. They came around repeatedly talking to the passengers and making sure we were comfortable and seemed to genuinely care. In fact their efforts helped overcame the other deficiencies in the hard product. Compared to the brusque automatons on United these folks were full of smiles and eager to please. Also the Indian food selection was delicious. The negatives: compared to the premium airlines AI is clearly not as polished or well organized. Meals were provided all at once in a single tray - not course by course as on other airlines. Menus was not provided. Wine choice was very limited. Champagne was served lukewarm. After dinner the crew disappeared and did not patrol the aisles refilling glasses - but then passengers were asleep and I'm sure if anyone had requested they would have come right away. Movie selection though limited was not as bad as I had imagined. It would be nice to have served a quick snack or wake-up drink prior to landing. It was strange that the only announcement we got to wake us up was the one saying we were preparing to land! Overall a good product and definitely exceeded expectations. Not on par as Singapore, Emirates and Asian carriers but solidly good overall.\",\n",
       " \"I was sceptical about flying ANA's new 3-4-3 economy layout, but I was pleasantly surprised by the level of comfort I experienced in the economy cabin. The seat pitch is still phenomenal and leaves plenty of room for passengers sitting in front of me to recline all the way back. The seats are soft yet supportive and the PTV system is full of options to make the twelve hour flight seem like a short haul route. ANA's flight attendants are world class, constantly moving about the cabin offering drinks and snacks between meals. \",\n",
       " 'Fleet of A319 and A320 in this route. Fast check in and fast track, what fast track! Took longer that other pax! Good lounge and well services and staffed one. Boarding ok, flight itself lacks the extra mile, they have no time nor the wish to make your money worth it. Same shame on the return. Bags first out which was a surprise.',\n",
       " \"Overall a good value for money experience with EasyJet. Was flying from Luton Airport to Nice on a Sunday morning. Upon arrival at the airport, as check in now happens online it was easy to just queue up and drop the bags off at the bag drop desks. Though it's not favourable having so many flights queueing up for around 8 desks the queues were not that bad and the airline were beginning to open more desks. Worst thing about this bag drop system is that those running late don't have an individual desk so have to queue up for a while or use flight closures. The next step of the journey involving the airline was boarding. This happened efficiently and despite the flight being full speedy boarding wasn't needed as overhead locker space was easily avaliable when on board. The cabin crew (4) were helpful, friendly and very presentable. The leg room and seat comfort was as expected. As only a short flight there was no need to purchase any snacks or drinks but as with most airlines items were a touch pricey but there was a decent selection. Our flight was delayed by 40 minutes leaving Luton due to a wait for a take off slot from ATC this delay did seem longer as the aircraft was boarded by 0650 and didn't take off till 0750. Not expected but would of been nice to have screens to follow the route and the captain/first officer gave very little updates. Despite the delay leaving due to a tail wind we did only arrive 15 minutes late. Baggage was delivered in Nice T2 around 15 minutes after disembarking the aircraft which was very speedy. Good experience with EasyJet would advise booking early for cheaper flights but if your able to be flexible that also helps. Overall good experince with EasyJet and looking forward to our return journey with the airline.\",\n",
       " \"Great flight from JFK to Milan. The aircraft is new and roomy. Lots of great entertainment to watch on the widescreen seat monitors. Seats were very comfortable. We were seated by the galley, which unfortunately, was a little noisy and was hard to sleep, but other than that, I can't wait to fly Emirates again. One of the better airlines I've been on. Our return flight home a couple weeks later was also a really good experience. Thumbs up to Emirates! (at least to this particular plane and route).\",\n",
       " 'All was fine: ground services, cabin crew, food and beverages. The seat was very comfortable and the ICE system had  a great selection of movies and other live programs. The cabin was very silent and the WiFi network worked fine. ',\n",
       " 'The service provided by the cabin crew was excellent, escorted to our suites, individually addressed by name. The suites are excellent and the facilities great, especially the ICE entertainment. The shower is out of this world, we both had three each. The business class bar has a good selection of drinks and snacks, the bar staff being particularly friendly. The first class bar is self serving again wth snacks and rolls,and a great selection of spirits. Not forgetting the dining, silver service with an option to eat at our own convenience. Choice of food excellent, accompanying wine and champagne first class. ',\n",
       " 'Amsterdam to Moscow with Estonian Air, which proved to be good choice. AMS to Tallinn leg was carried on a CRJ200. They served complementary coffee, water and a chocolate. Transfer at Tallinn was seamless, their non Schengen area consists of a few gates and one restaurant. The connecting flight to Moscow was on a slightly worn Embraer 170, leg room okay but the interior had seen better times. Service on both flights was very formal and a smile was nowhere to be seen. Would fly them again due to the easy transfers.',\n",
       " 'I was on flight GA719 to Denpasar and GA718 to Melbourne in economy class. The seat was wide, good legroom, had an inflight entertainment system and was clean. Garuda gave us 2 hot meals, 2 snacks and drinks were given often over this 6hr flight. The flight attendants were nice and friendly, lavatories were spotless and a very friendly pilot. ',\n",
       " \"The plane's interior was updated and nice. The food was the best I've eaten on any flight in economy flying from Europe to US. I was very impressed. Other than that the rest was average. There wasn't any real or major disappointments with the cabin crew but I didn't real feel extra special or overly accommodated for. It was just average. Other than that no complaints.\",\n",
       " 'SIN-KUL. At time of booking this was the cheapest fare I could find, including budget airlines considered. Was pleasantly surprised to be assigned the exit seat, even more surprised to find that the aircraft was waiting for me to board (usually the other way round for all other flights). Aircraft looked brand new, IFE was worthy for long-haul travel. Simple snack and drink was provided and crew was friendly. Service comparable to legacy airlines and I would definitely fly with them again.',\n",
       " 'Lots of bad reviews, so we kept our fingers crossed and everything worked out fine. Flew their \"premium\" class one way Gatwick to LAX and this fare was about the same price as the next cheapest which was Air New Zealand economy class, (32 seats in this class - all others are economy, and everything is provided for you at no additional cost for \"premium\"). Plane took off/arrived on time - no problem there. Attendants were professional and pleasant. This was a 787, but kind of like buying a car with no extras as the reclining seats were manual, (they are like the old business class seats- wide and reclining, but not lay flat and controls not automatic). Entertainment fine. This is not like flying a legacy airline business class - stemware is thin plastic, utensils plastic, meal served like a box-lunch, but I would do it again considering it was only about $350 more for the 11 hour flight to fly premium.',\n",
       " \"Flew from CDG-MXP-ISB. Check in was uneventful, however, the 'Premiere Lounge' is pathetic. There was no decent food selection available, and the only things on display were packets of pot noodles and 3 cold salami sandwiches. So, as soon as it was announced the gate was open, we fled the lounge and went to the gate. After passing through security, we realised there was a 15-minute delay. Finally, boarding was announced, and, much to my dismay, there was no priority boarding! We finally boarded the flight and were taken to our seats by the cabin crew. Moments later, the purser appeared with a range of juices and hot towels. In terms of seat comfort, I found the seat to be comfortable, and after flying EK's, EY's and QR's Business Class, didn't find it to be all that bad. After a 10 minute delay, we took off, and the IFE was turned on while the crew prepared for snacks, consisting of sandwiches, chicken 'rolls', cake and tea/coffee. After snacks, we began our descent and landed in MXP, and the ground staff cleaned the plane while we remained seated. After everyone had boarded, we were given juices and cold towels again, and soon after, we took off, 10 minutes behind schedule. We were given our amenity kits, and the rest of the flight was uneventful. Dinner consisting of a steak, curry, rice, lentils and vegetables was served, along with dessert, which was cheesecake or a plateful of chocolate eclair and lights were turned off for passengers to go to sleep. I fell asleep and woke up with only 2 hours to ISB when lights were turned on for Breakfast. Breakfast consisted of a sandwich, a croissant, coffee/tea, a roll, cold chicken cuts and a shashlik. About 1 and a half hour after breakfast we landed, right on time. De-boarding was swift, and soon enough I was in ISB. It was a wonderful flight, and definitely worth the money!\",\n",
       " \"Flew Economy for MNL-BKK and back for a short trip to Bangkok. Cabin crew were very attentive. On my flight to Bangkok, a woman was complaining about the only two meal choices available for Economy (pork and beef), but the staff were able to produce chicken and vegetarian meals for her. The seat pitch was a bit narrow, but once you recline your seat it doesn't seem so bad. On the return flight, we rode on a B777 and I was glad for the individual IFE. My seatmate's though kept restarting every fifteen minutes or so, and she had to select another movie that would play until the end. Food was okay, I liked the ones in our first flight better.\",\n",
       " 'Great experience from check in at the airport, to arrival. The best business class product in the market. FA give the best service. Doha new airport is efficient and nice to walk around. On board Qatar Airways has great seats, nice food, great IFE. My bags arrived first on belt.',\n",
       " \"We were allowed 2 free checked bags apiece. They gave us a free glass of champagne and a tasty little mini sub on the way down, and free red wine and a yummy pizza pocket on the way back. We got to watch a movie, and the nonstop flight (both to and fro) was uneventful, and pretty much on time. The staff were friendly and they even did all the announcements in French, as well as English. I'd definitely fly Sunwing again.\",\n",
       " 'I normally fly with Virgin, hence I was a little uncertain about the journey. The journey both going and coming home was excellent. The staff were lovely. The pilot gave the passengers info as and when needed. From start to finish I could not fault it. I will travel with Thomson again.',\n",
       " 'I found all the staff I interacted with friendly and professional, the aircraft was clean, the food was fine but not enough. The seats were a nice size. I had never flown with United before and was pleasantly surprised. Although I was sat next to morbidly overweight people on both my flights the seats were big enough that the people next to me did not squeeze onto my seat like they usually do on Virgin flights which I liked. I was late getting to the gate (very much my fault) and the initial employee I spoke to was rude and short with me and refused to even see if I could make it to the flight even though my baggage was still on board and the food was not yet delivered to the plane, she told me \"no, you aren\\'t getting on the flight\" and refused to even see if it was a possibility. Thank goodness for the other lady who phoned someone, told me I was fine to get on the plane because they were waiting for the food and my luggage was still aboard, and sent me through. I slept most of the flight to the UK. The touch screen with my seat on the way back to the USA was really finicky which was a bit annoying, I liked the selection of movies and that they played as soon as I was sat in my seat rather than waiting till after take off for them to work. I bought duty free stuff inflight and the staff that helped me were friendly and helpful. I would recommend this airline and will use it again.',\n",
       " 'Round trip Newark to Rome on an updated Boeing 767. Coach seats very comfortable. IFE was good, on demand movies, tv. Meals were edible, which is all I have come to hope for. Flights on time and bags arrived with us. Only issue was the surly treatment from almost all the flight attendants. Don\\'t know why they hate their customers so much. I fly with United Airlines often, but they either need to lose the \"friendly skies\" tag line or, better yet, train their crew in the basics of good customer service.',\n",
       " 'Arrived somewhat early for the flight and had to wait an hour for check-in to open as the queue continued to grow. However, check-in staff were friendly and quickly got through the line. A full flight so boarding was a tad chaotic moreso due to passengers not obeying the gate announcements. The flight closed up 25 mins after scheduled takeoff time (8.35pm) and consequently the pilot informed us we missed our slot and could not be airborne until 9.50pm Luckily, the situation improved and we took off at 9.30pm arriving in Dublin only 15 mins behind schedule. The senior cabin manager was delightful, accommodating and always smiling. Nice flight, efficient inflight service, cockpit updates and baggage delivered very quickly upon arrival. All in all a very good experience despite the initial delays.',\n",

To my surprise, me and family did not have any negative experiences a lot of other commenters had. I'm 5'10 and found the seats to have average legroom just like any other airline I've flown. The crew were professional, helped out immediately when someone needed it, and served with a smile. The food to me was good, obviously not restaurant fancy, but good and filling. Drinks and bottled water, not tap, was offered every now and then. Although there is no screen in front of you to provide you with in-flight entertainment or location, they have an app that you can download on your Apple or Android where you can access some good movies from. I had no problem connecting to it and it kept me entertained for the long flight. Overall, I would fly with them again.\",\n",

Little time made up of passage to Melbourne so arrived about 1.5 hours late which did squeeze connections from Melbourne. Air India had rebooked passengers who missed their connections and this was communicated on arrival as to new flight details Flight was comfortable with 2 meals plus snack and drinks offered.

Meal choice of Indian veg or meat plus European choice of chicken with pasta. Drinks also offered each service. Crew offered plenty of water or juice throughout the flight and snacks and drinks available in the galley if required. Restrooms kept clean during flight.

Service was fine and a meal offered and drinks. Lots of movies and shows to watch for 3 hour hop across Tasman arriving on time back in Christchurch. It was always going to be a struggle and none of the delayed passengers luggage made the connection so remained in Melbourne. It is moments like this that AIR NZ customer service comes to the front and you can see why they look after their passengers. Details were taken and arrangements made with bags placed on the next flight arriving in late at night. Air NZ called first thing to advise bags had arrived and would be delivered that morning by van. Don't blame Air NZ for bags missing flight and the efforts to make sure the delay was kept to a minimum was good.\",\n",
       " 'Quick online check-in and boarding passes with the BA mobile APP. It is so easy to use and definitely helps you to get rid of those annoying loose bits of paper from your cabin bags. Manchester Airport Terminal 3 is bursting at the seams during the summer holiday mornings. There\\'s a severe lack of seats in this terminal but despite this, the security check didn\\'t take too long at all. The BA ground staff at Manchester seemed friendly enough and boarded strictly in groups from the back of the aircraft to the front. This helps stop the queuing in the aisles onboard to get to your seat. We were greeted at the aircraft door by a couple of cheerful and friendly crew. The refreshed cabin now looks very modern, welcoming and clean. The comfort of the new seats and the space on this aircraft (A321) I feel would be more than sufficient for a flight of 2-3 hours or so (I\\'m 5ft 11\"). With a fully loaded cabin and a flight time to Heathrow of just over 30 minutes the crew were quick into action. We were offered a hot breakfast bacon wrap, orange juice and tea or coffee, perfect for such a short flight and definitely helps set BA apart from the competition. The flight arrived into Terminal 5 a few minutes ahead of schedule and outside the UK Arrivals area less than ten minutes later.',\n",

I was hesitant when booking but the fares were extremely good. The flight attendants were wonderful and I was impressed by their professionalism and concern for the passengers needs and comfort. The food and drink was very good. The plane being a new 787 Dreamliner was immaculate and this is the fastest flight I have had to Dublin. The direct route from LAX to DUB definitely filled a void since Aer Lingus pulled out several years ago. I would recommend this airline. The prices are reasonable and the service is fantastic. The hours of this flight are a little odd leaving LAX around midnight. The Dublin flight leaves for LAX at 6.15 am. If you can deal with those hours then this airline is the way to travel. No more flying 5 plus hours to the east coast laying over for hours and then having another 7 hour journey ahead. Our flight time was a little over 9 hours to Ireland.',\n",

Lounge in TPE is quite crowded and the food is not as good as in BKK although they do offer Haagen Dazs ice cream. Inflight service is by name and attentive. Cabin crew are pleasant and quite strict in enforcement of inflight safety measures. Love the Harn amenities in the bathroom with facial mist. Rimowa amenity bag is legendary 180 degrees flat bed is remarkable. I wish the TV monitor was not put back to its back seat position during take off/landing as I miss out the last chunk of the movie.

I will most likely choose to fly with them next time we go to Fiji, but I would not travel on longer flights to Los Angeles or Hong Kong on Fiji Airways. I'd like to also point out to people connecting to the US on Fiji Airways, any drinks or duty free alcohol in your hand luggage brought from your origin will be taken off you.\",\n",

       " 'The aircraft operated from KUL to ICN was a B777-300ER which coincidentally turned 4 years old on the day of my flight. Although the configuration was 3-3-3, the seats felt rather cramped due to the premium cabins covering half the aircraft which surprised me. The Asian vegetarian meal I ordered was great and staff efficiency was excellent. Inflight entertainment only featured Korean, Japanese and Chinese films in addition to Hollywood which I felt was rather limited. Would have been better if there were other language films such as Indian on board since KE recently announced its intentions to expand in India. Transit in ICN was hassle free and easy to locate gates with lots of shopping and Korean cultural experiences. ICN to CTS was a brand new A330-300 and felt way more comfortable than the B777-300ER as I heard the premium cabin is one of the smallest in Korean Air. Overall a good experience and would consider them again.',\n",

After arriving in Frankfurt, due to short connection, direct transfer with a limousine was already organized. LH440 - 06/07/2015, A380. Unfortunately when arriving at the gate to Houston, plane was delayed due to technical issues. Ground staff were confused, delayed the boarding twice. Boarding started about 45 min later than normal. Due to the amount of seats in business class, there were already 2 lines of about 40 people each for the boarding process. When boarding started the ground staff did that manually in only one line, without activating the two self service scanners. After 20 min I went to the purser and asked if she can assist me with boarding (First/Sen). She told me the boarding process had already started (sure, I was waiting there) and I can board after queuing in the line. After I asked why the scanners were not activated, she looked confused around and asked some colleagues, who then activated the scanners, which gave me the possibility to board. Unfortunately already a lot of people from Economy had boarded, which caused a delay on the stairs to the two bridges (First/Business and Economy). Overall my worst boarding process flying First with LH. Welcome on board was great, service and food thru the entire flight the same. Great people and a big thank you to the team of LH. The pilot could not catch up, so when we landed in Houston and the door opened, I had 10 minutes connection time to the boarding to TPA on C34.

Food not served with any menu card like previous leg, had to ask staff to show before serving and it was cold. Plane was dirty could see clumps of dirt and dust on the floor.

Then I started going through the booking process. A few steps later I found out they are going charge me $35 for a carry-on. Well, that totaled to $108. It was still better than other flights. I went a little further. Then they say that they would charge $10 for checking in and for boarding passes. I ended up booking it up for him. But, guess what? Today was his flight. He printed the tickets and boarding passes yesterday at home. Got to the airport on time today and his flight left 20 minutes in advance of the schedule. He got to Chicago earlier than he was supposed to be. I am just saying that yes maybe Spirit Airlines isn't that great and it might have some negative points. But, I think it still has some hope. As for the first experience, I will give it a 10.\",\n",
       " 'Brussels to Barcelona via Zurich. Brussels - Z체rich in old but very clean Avro - decent cold continental breakfast - friendly FA - business class passengers immediately do receive still mineral water in bottle when boarding. Lounge in Zurich very good, Z체rich to Barcelona in very clean Airbus 321 - pleasant flight very good cold meal with good Swiss white wine, FA once again extremely courteous, on both flights the traditional swiss chocolates. Only minor point: very long waiting time for luggage delivery but that is proverbial in Barcelona airport - nearly 40 minutes.',\n",
       " \"LGW-CUN-LGW. Having previously flown Virgin, we were very much looking forward to this trip and we were not disappointed! Both flights were served by the airline's refreshed boeing 747's, and they were very comfortable to fly in - the new economy seats on this aircraft are without a doubt some of the most comfortable we have ever used on long haul. However, I did notice that both planes seemed to echo an eerie sense of flying back in the 1980s/90s, despite them both having been refreshed - eg: old style overhead fittings and noisy cabins. Moreover, the touch screen IFE was quite tedious to use, depite it's generous offering of films and music. I would suggest that the airline deploy their newer airbus A330-300s on more of their Gatwick routes, as they are, in contrast, quieter, more modern and comfortable. However, both sectors had excellent crews who were eager to engage with their passengers, and it was clear that they took a pleasure in their duties. In addition, it is pleasing to see that Virgin have retained some thoughtful touches, such as amenity kits. However, the meal service is a big let down. The catering quality is fine, but portions do need to be bigger, especially on a long flight of 11 hours. Moreover, the snack service could also be revamped, as it is still very limited and has not improved since our last flight with Virgin two years ago. Clearly, the Virgin Atlantic economy experience delivers a solid product, but still leaves room open for improvement. We would certainly consider flying the airline again, but would try to avoid flying the 747 in favour of the airbus A330-300, due to it's enhanced comfort.\",\n",
       " 'Very good flight with Aegean. The boarding was quickly and the crew very . During the flight, we had no entertainment (no films, no flight info). The food was an olive bread with a free no-alcoholic beverage (the first was free). Very smooth landing at Heraklion.',\n",

       " 'I had a connection in Dublin for 2 hours, which stresses me out the most. During the JFK-DUB leg, the crew was the most hospitable crew I have met. My seat was broken, making me recline without pressing the button, and the IFE had a pretty poor choice of movies, but other than that, Aer Lingus left me with an impression. Dublin Airport is clean, and when I was there for the connection, we were the only outbound flight, so the terminal was empty. Would fly with Aer Lingus again, especially with their incredible prices.',\n",

       " \"The quality of the airline has deteriorated badly. My first connection BOM-DEL was delayed with prior intimation which was fine. I reached DEL at the eleventh hour when the boarding for PAR had already begun. I met the worst ground staff at DEL airport who don't even know how to behave with a passenger and behave as if doing a big favour. I was not attended by any transit desk people and when contacted the AI staff asked me to run behind people on transit to other destinations that was just so cheap. Next thing was the annoying security check which took nearly 30 minutes with a quick immigration for transit passengers. The flight was quite empty and quite comfortable, with friendly cabin crew. But the flight was mostly full of foreigners and the announcement was missing in French and the really fast Indian English was really sad for the French people who kept asking me to translate what they meant. Arrival in Paris was very smooth. I wouldn't mind flying with AI but I would never ever fly via DEL airport again in my life except for my return flight and I would not mind shelling out some extra chunks for this matter. The ticket was the cheapest even at the last minute.\",\n",
       " 'Staff professional and impeccable service during the flight. Very tasty food served, 3 announcements were made by the cockpit during the flight. Landed in Belgrade with a minor 15-20 min delay. The only negative would be that during boarding there was no priority boarding call and no express boarding line for business passengers.',\n",
       " 'I was a nervous wreck for 2 weeks leading up to this trip due to the horrible reviews. This flight was delayed approx 30 min. Boarding was fast and efficient.

You get what you pay for.',\n",
       " \"We decided to fly Asiana Airlines because of their competitive fares (cheaper by $300 than other premium carriers) and complimentary hotel stays at the Grand Hyatt for the layover. Transfers were one of the easiest we've experienced especially on the return flights. London ground agents booked our seats not just to Seoul but Sydney as well, and our bags were automatically transferred by the airline to our Sydney plane as there was no layover. This gave us more time to relax in the lounge. Onboard experience was fantastic. Three out of the four legs had excellent flat beds and only the Sydney to Seoul leg had angled seats which were great for a day flight but I'd question its comfort overnight. What was truly memorable was the gracious and respectful cabin service on every single flight. The crew seemed like they weren't just great attendants but great people in general. Great food and extensive selection of alcoholic drinks. The whole experience was memorable for us in a pleasant way and we'll certainly fly Asiana again.\",\n",

The cabin crew was also helpful. Inflight menu has improved from the last time when I travelled 3 years ago. Dhaka to Chittagong flight was A310 and bad weather. Not the best aircraft to fly.',\n",

Bag drop at Copenhagen T2 was fast, and our carry-on bags inspected for number and size. easyJet use the low-cost terminal F at Copenhagen airport, which is pretty sparten but well lit and clean. Having been marshalled at the gate, (with seating for only 15 people travelling in Plus, and no seating for Economy), it is just a short walk to the aircraft for boarding, which goes smoothly as both front and rear doors are used. In bad weather this exposure could be slightly unpleasant, as bottle-necks would mean waiting on the aircraft steps. However, all is good on board. The cabin is clean and tidy, the flight staff good humoured, and the blessing of a non-reclining seat-back so that the passenger in front of you cannot recline their seat as soon as possible, and perhaps leave it in that position for the whole of the flight ?? wonderful. BRS to CPH. Bag drop opened 3 hours before the flight time which is a boon. The inbound aircraft was slightly late, and therefore we could witness the arrival passengers struggle across the tarmac against heavy rain in their scanty holiday clothes. Luckily we had our travel umbrellas as, in addition, we were held up on the aircraft steps for a minute or two. Again, a cheerful crew who dealt with their cabin duties in a professonal manner. The captain made up for the late start, and we arrived on time in Copenhagen.',\n",
       " 'They had the new thinner seats on this flight and it made the journey an absolute joy. I am 6 feet 3 inches tall and I could fully stretch out. The flight left on time, boarding was easy and the cabin crew were helpful and professional. Not my usual budget airline experience.',\n",

Thank you and we definitely will travel with you again and highly recommend you.',\n",
       " 'Better aircraft now with the B777-300ER unlike before with the old B747s - very significant improvement. Cabin lights were changing from light yellow to purple. I had the seafood meal which was OK. Inflight entertainment has a fairly good selection of movies (still with blurs and cuts though). Price not very far from the competing airline that offers direct route from DMM-MNL  (about 50 to 100 SAR difference) but still provides full airline service. One negative thing is the boarding gate in MNL airport terminal 1. There were not enough seats for the all the passengers. Some were standing up while waiting for boarding. Check-in process was OK. Good value for money. Can compare now with Emirates and Etihad.',\n",

I booked tickets several weeks in advance and got a good value flight. The website was clear with what one needed to pay extra. With the flight only an hour, I didn\\'t want to pay extra for premium economy seats that would\\'ve guaranteed a more comfortable flight for a tall person like me (2m). Yet, I hoped that if the flight wasn\\'t fully booked the staff would be flexible and allow me to sit in an exit row. Years of flying have continued to confirm to me that if you want service and flexibility, go with the \"legacy\" airlines, as opposed to the \"low-cost\" ones where you have to pay for everything. Once again, I politely asked and the Aer Lingus staff happily obliged - on both trips. As such, I was very pleased for the quality I got on this short-haul flight within the UK. I\\'ve not flown Aer Lingus long-haul, so I can\\'t comment, but based on this experience I would be ready to try Aer Lingus transatlantically if they offered a good price and connection.',\n",

TV screens for each seat with a some choice of English and Chinese/Japanese Lagrangian movies. All seats with blankets and head sets. Food predominantly Chinese and Japanese (understandably), Soft drinks beer and Alcohol served before meal. Toilets were clean. The onboard duty free was decent and well conducted. Typically, Chinese returning passengers, carry a lot of hand baggage. Great flight for the price compared to ANA/JAL. We were so apprehensive before booking online (reading many negative reviews). I strongly recommend Air China for this sector.',\n",

The flight was excellent and the crew in Club Europe were as always providing excellent service and professional at all times. Although the 767 is showing its age, I still prefer this aircraft to the A320's which also are used on this route, on the 767 at least the Club Europe seats are comfortable and offer plenty of leg room unlike the new Club Europe which is used on the A320's which is in reality going back to the days of charter airlines! So come on British Airways lets go back to the old configurations where we have plenty of leg room in Club Europe and reduce the rows of seats, we do not want Low Cost Airline look alikes otherwise we would fly them, we choose BA because we are loyal to you so bring back your old standards once again.\",\n",
       " 'An extremely efficient check-in with the airline offering to take heavier cabin bags in the hold for free. As a regular user of shorthaul cheap airlines I was impressed with the whole experience. The cabin crew were a delight and went out of their way to keep the passengers amused and informed. The food and drinks were not overpriced and were edible. Although the seats were quite tight they were not unduly uncomfortable. Arriving in Malta we left the plane quickly and the bags arrived within a matter of minutes.',\n",

I was shocked that the agent were more interested in staring at their iPhone than greeting their customers. Was traveling with another two companions and we checked-in together. However, our seats were different and once airborne, we were surprised that there were so many empty seats at towards the end of the plane. Inflight service was a different story altogether. The cockpit crew and the cabin crew really interacted with the passengers and were very friendly. Malindo has a PTV for each seat and they provided great IFE for a short flight.',\n",

They offered a flight from Rome, but later learnt that it was full. We turned back to Florence. Two days later we went to Pisa Airport -very small - We checked in normally.

Crew rarely smiled, and didn't appear friendly or approachable. Food of decent quality for economy, drinks limited. Water was warm and served from strange plastic jugs, which makes me think we were drinking tank water. Service was rushed. Entertainment was of very good selection and easy to use. No drink or snack runs until breakfast served.  No amenities however bathrooms kept clean. Crew friendlier on return flight but nothing above average. If the price is significantly cheaper it may be worth flying CI, otherwise I'd spend a bit more and fly with a different airline.\",\n",

Even though SYD-DPS had to be diverted to SUB (our hometown), we were unable to end our journey in SUB, but had to fly to DPS since our itinerary was SYD-DPS-SUB.

Our flight from DPS-SUB also was delayed by two hours, sadly a piece of our luggage did not arrive in SUB. All Check-in process at three airports was quick. Priority boarding went smoothly.

Food is great, views of the terminal are excellent, there are showers, resting areas, TV watching areas, and a couple of beverage stands at both ends of the lounge. Boarding was conducted in a very organized form using two bridges: one for Business Plus and one for the main cabin, and allowing families with children and elderly to board first which is always a great gesture. Cabin was clean, and flight attendants welcomed passengers in a friendly way. The new seat is superb: private, comfortable and lies almost flat allowing for a reasonable sleep. Entertainment system also had a great selection of movies, games, and TV shows. Food selections were good quality, although portions were a bit small. Flight attendants were able to suggest wine and were quite generous about serving it. Once service concluded, a self service bar was set up in front. One thing I liked about Iberia is that flight attendants are not intrusive, which can be confused with uninterested. This is probably a cultural misunderstanding, because while other carriers have an almost prying and intrusive service, in Spain, it is considered respectful to let people reach out if they need something. All in all an enjoyable experience.',\n",

Service onboard was great food much better compared to US carriers along with dessert though KLM lacks in drinks offers with a limited selection of mainly wine and beer.

Had economy comfort seat (window) on A330 to AMS which gives you extra 4 inches of space, nice Indonesian-inspired meal, uneventful flight. Schiphol non-Schengen section under renovation and therefore confusing, but it is still one of the best transfer airports, though the lounges in CDG offer better food. Flights AMS-WAW-AMS were fine and on time. Return AMS-YYZ delayed 2 hrs and A330 replaced by B747, however, when boarding got upgrade to business so can't complain.

       " 'Second round trip with Ryanair this year and all went fairly smoothly. Had booked early for a good price and managed to check in for return flight at home before leaving for Liverpool airport early in the morning, so avoided any extra charges. Did have a 30 minutes delay on the outward journey which was attributed to Belgian ATC because of the \"very busy skies over Europe this morning\", but since boarding (for an early morning flight) did not start till about 20 minutes before scheduled departure time I suspect we simply missed our designated slot. Also there was a puzzling request from the cabin manager that passengers should make sure they sat in their allocated seats because of the carefully arranged weight distribution. Given that the plane was completely full, how and where was weight distribution arranged? Plenty of sales pitches on both legs, but my impression was that many of the passengers just switched off and sales were actually fewer than on flights I\\'ve had with easyJet. None of the past quibbling over cabin baggage and even on the full outward flight everyone seemed to get their bags stowed in the lockers with crew members\\' assistance. Ryanair certainly seems to be more passenger-friendly these days but it is still advisable to be aware of the rules to avoid any possible pitfalls.',\n",

On return from VGO the flight was delayed without sending notices via the Vueling mobile app. Arrived at the airport on time and proceeded to check-in and was stopped by Vueling agent to pay for carry on bag. Informed the Vueling agent that coming from BCN Vueling did not charge me for the carry-on agent could care less. Anyways paid with trusted credit card so I could call them once back home in the USA. Got to the gate and notice all the locals with the same size carry-on bags as mine were not made to check them in. Some had bigger carry-on bags that could be classified as checked in luggage. While at the gate no information that the only flight flown by Vueling on Saturday was delayed by two hours. As the night went on in VGO we went back to Iberia which was handling the Vueling flight as the Vueling ground crew left the airport. Told flight will come but if it gets cancelled you are on your own for hotel. Note Vigo is small town lacking hotels. Finally the plane arrived from Barcelona with a fresh crew and made a quick turn around. Since the flight was delayed 2+ hours by the time we left Vigo it was now 11pm. We arrived back at 1am having to wait for Vueling to located ground crew in Barcelona as most the Vueling planes had already returned for the night and the airport while it is open 24 hours keeps limited people on hand after 12am. The hold in Barcelona was not acceptable being that Barcelona is Vueling's hub. I would fly Vueling again but I will fly them with being sure to take morning flights in case of any delays also keep my trusted Credit Card on hand to dispute carry on charge for not being local.\",\n",
       " \"Sadly this airline struggles to deliver time after time. They own the 'worst ever flying experience' tag after a 12 hour airport delay in Seville a few years back and judging by recent experiences they still have room for improvement. My latest involved a 3 hour delay on a hot Saturday afternoon. It was apparent that the 'delayed departure' time was never credible and sure enough no sooner had we settled in our uncomfortable leg roomed seats a further announcement was made. Sadly a relief crew had to be called in as the current one would have breached their permitted maximum hours of work had they continued. I addressed the issue with the captain and asked why he had not called operations earlier, surely he had realised earlier. Muffled response. I also suggested he chased operations after the relief crew also arrived after 'time'. The 150 odd passengers had to sit around while they finally got their act together. As a token gestutre they offered a cup of still water and a McD hamburger to those desiring same. Until incompetence and sub standard performances of airlines are felt in their bottom lines (ie they have to offer monetary compensation to their loyal customers) I see little changing. Problems will always happen, it is how you deal with them that ultimately separate one provider from another.\",\n",
       " \"No delays to or from Puerto Vallarta. Unlike Sunwing the trip before. So you don't get a meal free, but you get much better service. We have flown with WestJet on three other flights to Mexico, only one time was there a delay, but we were given a food voucher and kept up to date,unlike SW. Do think they should make everyone put carry ons in the sizers like Air Canada is doing! We will continue to use WestJet.\",\n",

       " \"Flew out economy but paid extra to get 35A which is an exit row seat. Seat was ok but a bit snug width-wise. Queues for the loos tended to stand right in front of me so it was a busy area. Inflight entertainment was good but would benefit from more recent films. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful and always happy to answer questions. Food was really good, a lot better than other economy flights I have taken. Coming back I upgraded to Business Class and was given seat 7a. I didn't get to choose as I missed my original flight due to a connecting flight cancellation so was just happy to have made the flight. Seat was ok but uncomfortable in fully flat mode - it would have been a lot more comfortable with an extra cushion layer. Flight attendants were friendly but rushed to get everything done before people wanted to sleep. Food was good but some choices ran out quite quickly. I liked the idea of pre-ordering breakfast and letting them know if you wanted to be woken for it or not. Overall a good flight, a lot better than the experience I had on my connecting flights with Jazz\",\n",

Food and drink good and free, a bonus. Cabin attendants, an older purser up front a bit patronising. The two in economy were really going through the motions, no eye contact and perfunctory service. 1 drink served in a 2.5 hour flight. For the last hour the two at the back were eating Club Europe meals which I saw them bring from the front. This was BA2591 on 22 July. Not great.\",\n",

We used rewards to fly Club World and enjoyed it. We have flown BA long haul several times and they have earned our return business.\",\n",

The layover in Kingston, Jamacia was interesting with beautiful views of the ocean (there was a non stop flight to Orlando the next day but I needed to arrive one day early so I had to make a stop). Once again we were on our way to Orlando, this time there was only a beverage service due to the short flight, we arrived in Orlando on-time 3.15pm. On the return leg (BW 485) back to Trinidad and Tobago (POS) on the 22nd June 2015, check in and the boarding process was once again quick and efficient, this time I came back on a non-stop flight, the flight departed on time 3.15pm. The meal was once again delicious with lasagne being offered. The flight arrived 20 minutes before time! 7.00pm as has been all my flights with this airline.

Excellent airline and the service cannot be faulted.',\n",

The food was served late, even after many requests for some snacks (my kids got hungry), the crew didn't manage to give anything. There were no vegetarian options left. The entertainment was cut off during half the flight. However, once in Bahrain everything went smoothly. The check-in was delightful. The crew were very pleasant and the flights were on time. The food was very nice and the entertainment was perfect. Our return was perfect - the only down side was the first journey.\",\n",

The staff were helpful at the desk and the whole boarding procedure was quick and straightforward. On board, our seats were roomy, there was free wifi and TV's in the seat, for a 1hour 50min flight. We even received a free drink and snack. My husband watched football. I thought the cabin crew were presented well and they seem to have much more personality than any other airline I have recently travelled on. I was amazed that Jetblue is considered Budget as it is in a whole other league to the UK budget airline Easyjet. I would fly with them again.\",\n",

The flight was comfortable and staff very polite and obliging. I had not noticed at booking to change the meals to vegetarian. However the staff on board had vegetarian food available and ground staff organised it for return flight. Plenty of films. Water and fruit juice was regularly brought round, so we were not dehydrated. I wondered why the window screens were kept down and lights dimmed for majority of the journey?  A young child passenger was near me on return journey and I noticed how attentive the staff were to help the parents. In all a faultless journey. Thank you - had the same good service with this airline 2 years ago. Will use again in the future.',\n",

There were two check in staff for regular check in and two staff for priority check in. Leaving no one managing the Bag Drop Off Line. We waited for 40 mins and it was only once our flight started boarded they prioritised us to the front of the queue, thank goodness. Once on the plane it was impressive with a modern cabin and personal IFE screens. Plane arrived on time to Sydney which turned out to be peak hour. Somehow though boarding started early for the flight to Brisbane. Again modern interior and personal IFE was a great touch. A very full flight with somehow took off on time. Meal options on both legs were great and tasty. Delay coming into Brisbane but this was Air Traffic reasons therefore no indication on Qantas' performance. Another great experience.\",\n",

The response of cabin crew was initially poor due to the lack of information about vegan food, though they apologised. On the next journey they compensated by offering additional fruits. Other than food, my flight experience was satisfactory, smooth check in, on time.',\n",

I was impressed with their website and ease of use. I managed to prebook seats, luggage, check in online etc. It's a no frills airline but you are paying such great prices so you cannot complain. The cabin crew were friendly and did a good job on board. The only negative comment I can say is that they had ran out of Prosecco (except for 1 bottle) on both flights and we were sitting in Row 3! The bar seemed poorly stocked and on the return flight I heard that there was no hot food available. I am not surprised as the passengers were only getting off our aircraft 5 minutes before we boarded it to return home. I never saw an aircraft turned around so quickly in all my years of travel. A big plus was no lost baggage and everything arrived home in one piece, including delicate pottery souvenirs etc. \",\n",

The stewardess were so friendly, attentive, and I felt they went the extra mile to ensure the passengers had a pleasant flight. I am tall and I was worried about the leg room, but I had plenty of leg room. The seats were wide enough and my family was comfortable during our 3.5 hour flight. We had champaign on our flight to our destination, it was okay, a nice touch. There was a meal which really was nothing more than a grown-up hot pocket. It was tasty, but nothing to write home about. All in all I would certainly fly with Sunwing again. ',\n",

The flight was delayed but only for 20 minutes. Once onboard, the crew were friendly, seat pitch good (due to the new economy seats - good for short haul) and the plane was clean. Food on offer was minimum but it was a hot dish which was better than the sandwich offerred on Lufthansa. Transfer in Zurich was smooth as usual. Zurich to London City flight was operated by Helvetic. A bit disappointing as the plane looked old and the crew were not as groomed as the Swiss flight. Leg room wasn't as great but it's only a short flight. A freshly made baguette was served along with choice of drinks. Took off and landed on time.\",\n",

       " \"I have flown with Turkish Air on previous occasions and found them very good. However this experience was well below their usual good record. Firstly I have to comment on the Turkish Airlines business lounge at Istanbul which would have to be the best lounge anywhere. But unfortunately it's a rose amongst the thorns as the rest of this airport is just awful and unfriendly. Our problems started at boarding where there was no priority whatsoever - in fact we were the last to board. Then the seats in the Boeing 737 are the same as you would expect on a 1 hour flight - very difficult to sleep sitting up. And the chef was missing which is a point of difference for this airline. This was an 11 hour overnight flight so they really need to upgrade the business product. We mysteriously had a 1 hour stopover at some Russian airport on the way that I was not expecting and was not able to use the business lounge there (small as it was). Lastly out bags came out without any priority. So I was really wondering why I paid 3 times the economy ticket price. I have previously been a strong supporter of Turkish Airlines but they let me down badly on this route. I would still recommend them if the plane has lay flat seats in business.\",\n",

However, it angered us that our carry-on bags, that were by Lufthansa standards (dimensions and weight), had to be checked on the return flight to Munich, yet fit perfectly on our flight from Munich to Venice two weeks earlier. If you have carry-on guidelines and people follow them, they should never be told that they must have to check them! A \"carry-on\" bag should be just that, one that you can bring on the plane.',\n",

Not only did they refund the ticket and reimburse us for the train tickets and hotel, but they gave us 짙250 flight vouchers as a gesture of goodwill. All of this in less than a week. Great airline on the other flights we did use them (SXB-LYS on a CRJ1000 and LYS-TLS on an A320). I would recommend them!',\n",
       " 'Inconsistent. Good flight from LGW, average from YUL Montreal. Outbound: We paid extra for Option Plus, which on this occasion was well worth it. We avoided check-in queues, used the fast track security lane, boarded first and our baggage was given priority on arrival. It also gave us a total luggage allowance of 33kg over two bags. On board we were given a comfort kit, sparkling wine, snack and an alcoholic drink. Food was bearable - no different really to any other airline. Leg room was adequate and seats had a good recline, but they are not very wide, so it was very uncomfortable and I\\'m not a big person. I was concerned when I discovered the A310 doesn\\'t have individual screens. Instead you have to watch on your iphone or tablet and there is no method of charging your device. Film choices appeared OK and battery held up surprisingly well. All in all we were pleasantly surprised, although our expectation couldn\\'t be any lower because we had read all the negative reviews. Inbound: Long wait at check in, just one person checking in Option Plus passengers. Despite having priority security with our ticket we were ushered through main security lanes. Flight was slightly delayed. No apology or explanation in fact it wasn\\'t even mention. Seat made it very uncomfortable and difficult to sleep. Food service was bizarre. Main pasta dish after midnight and breakfast was just a piece of banana bread! And \"priority bags\" appeared to come off at the same time as the others.',\n",

Smart attractive and efficient cabin crew, constant use of customer names (they memorized them from manifest before we boarded), well-maintained cabins, and delicious, plentiful food. High-end spirits and wines, including two choices for champagne, one of which was Krug. Quite simply, it was eleven hours of air travel the way it should be. As one example of the personal service I received, a FA noticed me yawn briefly after dinner and drinks, and in a heartbeat she was at my seat asking if I wanted her to make it into a bed. I told her not right now, thanks, and she said fine ??but then when I wasn\\'t looking she came up and made the seat across the aisle (first class wasn\\'t full) into a bed. and a few minutes after that she came by and said there\\'s your bed when you need it. So I went across and used it, put a blanket over me and the seatbelt over that, and went to sleep. I vaguely remember gentle touching while dozing. Come to find out later, when I was asleep she came by, thought the blanket wasn\\'t classy enough and tucked me in with a duvet on top of that.  If I had to pick any nits, it would be the first-class \\'suite\\' ground lounge in Tokyo. No real problems, nice enough food (plus Lindt chocolates which can help everything!), but it didn\\'t match up with Qantas SYD, Cathay Pacific HKG or Lufthansa FRA. And onboard, the the wifi service was usage-based, way overpriced, slow and not user friendly when one reached the quota. I am told, however, that as soon as this month ANA is moving from the usage to a time-based system. Finally, as nice as the \"square suites\" are, in a window suite the wall of the square interferes with a good view. But truly, those are nits. This was a terrific flight.',\n",

Asiana is my new go to for direct flights from LAX to Seoul. The A380 is extremely quite and smooth. No shaking or noise like the B747. The fully reclining leather seats are the most comfortable. The bathroom was the nicest I have seen including a port hole to see out. Toothbrushes and toothpaste were a nice touch in the bathroom. The all female staff were dressed to the \"nines\" and were polite. The food was wonderful. Wine choices very good. Asiana certainly has won my vote. US based carriers can learn a lot. ',\n",

We went to the BOA office in La Paz and were able to rebook without change fees. Only paid the fare difference. Finally flew out on the 18th but had a several hour delay out of La Paz. While this was not handled all that well by the ground staff this seemed to be par for the course - every other flight we have been on this year (in the USA) has had delays. Boarding was easy. Once the flight was announced, everyone just lined up and boarded. None of the convuluted boarding typical of airlines in the US and it only took about 15 minutes to board the plane. Since checked bags are free, there was no hassle for overhead space. Plane was economy class only with decent seat pitch. No extra charge to choose seats. Despite being a short flight, cabin crew came around with a complementary snack box and beverages. Plane was an older 737 but in reasonable shape and clean - I have flown in much more dilapidated planes on the legacy carriers. We had made a mistake on our booking for the return but were able to call BOA and rebook for the next day. Again, only paid the fare difference, in this case about US$8 each. Return flights (with connection in Cochabamba) were on time and the crew managed a snack service with drinks on the 35 minute flight from Cochabamba to La Paz. On the shorter flight from Sucre to Cochabamba they handed out snack packs to everyone. All in all a very good experience. Crews and ground staff generally pleasant and efficient. No \"gotcha\" fees and the fare was very reasonable. A nice change to what seems to be the general experience flying nowadays. Recommended.',\n",

While the aircraft appeared a little tired, I was impressed with the business class cabin service, catering was good for the series of short flights undertaken and seemed on a par with short-haul Qantas 737-800 international service. If requesting a seat during the booking process, I recommend selecting 1 D E or F. While there are three seats on this side of the aircraft rarely is the middle seat used. These seats are exit row and can, depending on the aircraft configuration, have up to almost a metre of legroom. All Business seats behind row 1 appear only to have legroom akin to economy class (which begs the question why pay so much extra for no more legroom). I fly business class regularly and would happily fly Comair again when next in Africa, and BA when travelling in Europe.',\n",

The first thing you notice at check in is the increase in self service kiosks previously the domain of domestic services, however ground support is swift and friendly, though it is no longer easy to get the plastic luggage bags at SYD airport. These should be readily available as in times past. Unfortunately only one main meal was served on this leg, plus what could only be described as a snack.

Good breakfast however a family member of mine was informed that they had run out of the breakfast meal she wanted.

Food was extremely basic and no coffee or tea was served, which is even worse than my trips with them few years ago. Cabin staff is decent and the plane arrived on time. Overall a little disappointed.\",\n",
       " 'Brand new A320, interior spotless. Crew immaculately groomed and attentive. Flight was on time. I was impressed with my first experience of Aegean.',\n",
       " 'I booked a premium economy ticket so I can have a suitcase and one piece of baggage. That cost ~30Euros more than the Go Light fare. Suddently as we were waiting for the boarding to start, the airline representatives announced that every person who has the Cheapest fare, can put his baggage in the compartment with no charge. I find no reason to pay extra money and being fooled with this policy. All the other provided services were far above medium, approaching excellence. I will fly again with Aegean but the ticket policy needs serious reconsideration',\n",
       " 'Round-trip New York-Moscow in Premium Economy was excellent. No problems with /check-in, both flights were on time, cabins were clean and seats were comfortable. The crew were pleasant and helpful, food was decent but the movies available on the AVOD were rather limited. The fare I paid was very reasonable and I think the Premium Economy service is an excellent value. All in all, I was extremely satisfied with Aeroflot and definitely would fly with them again.',\n",
       " 'Excellent experience. Good entertainment selection for the long flight, good food for airline food.',\n",
       " \"Smooth check-in aided by a friendly agent in Montreal. First leg to Toronto left and arrived on time. A small but tasty snack and full bar service was available on the short flight to Toronto and the FA was friendly and very efficient. Flight from Toronto to Beijing had an orderly boarding process and was ready for departure however a last minute delay was encountered to remove luggage belonging to a passenger who did not show up. The aircraft interior looked in dire need of an overhaul with floor boards torn off at the pods, food splattered on the pod walls and side panels of the seat hanging loose. The service from the FA's was warm and conducted efficiently. Food was of reasonable quality and quantity and it was good to see an updated menu. There was a good selection of wines, spirits and soft drinks but there were no hot beverages available during the 13 hour flight due to a maintenance problem. I learned later in the flight that the very same aircraft had been suffering from this for the last three weeks. IFE was disappointing as the content had not been updated for the last four months and did not match what was advertised on their website and magazines. The pod style seats need an upgrade as they are worn out and becoming uncomfortable. The flight arrived late but mainly due to congestion in Beijing. Luggage was delivered promptly. Overall it was an OK experience but lack of coffee and tea on a very long flight (especially to China) was inexcusable.\",\n",
       " 'Initially I was reluctant to fly Air Canada after all the bad press about their service and quality but I can only give a big thumbs up for overall service and friendliness of the crew. Food quality is poor, but no worse than most other airlines.',\n",
       " \"June 2015 I went on a small trip around Asia and I had 5 flights with AirAsia: HK-KL, KL-Jakarta, Jakarta-Singapore, Singapore-Bangkok, Bangkok-Xi'an. Beforehand, I read some reviews about AirAsia online and 99% of them were really bad. Everyone was complaining about delayed/changed flights and poor customer service. After all I read, I expected awful flights but in fact everything went smoothly. All flights were on time (except one - 2 hours delay) and customer service was good. And yes, you have to pay for drinks and food on board but come on, I got 5 flights around Asia for less than 짙200 altogether. I would fly with AirAsia again!\",\n",
       " 'We booked our trip a few months ago and just recently Allegiant has been in the news for delayed flights, mechanical issues, poor customer service etc. so of course we were worried about our flight. Our flight out of South Bend was very pleasant. Boarding went rather quickly and the staff were very nice. The flight went well and landing was smooth. We arrived in Vegas on time. Our flight home today went the same way and we arrived 20 mins early. ',\n",
       " 'A good journey. Sao Paolo to Per첬 cabin staff are excellent. Seat is full flat 180 degrees. Food choice very good. Avianca frequent flyer program is one of best. They give many many option for redeem miles. Like air flight, Hotel, purchase from different country.',\n",
       " 'I have flown Avianca  to and from Guayaquil and always been happy with the service. The staff are friendly and helpful and for the most part my Spanishor lack thereof, has not been a problem. The planes are clean and as comfortable as they ever get in the main cabin, food has been good and I enjoy having something now and then that is more typical of South American food. The one thing that I am not happy about is that I see they have changed their schedule so that my next trip will have to have two stops instead of just the one that I have typically had in San Salvador. It looks like they are now partnering with United and I will have to fly from Chicago to Dallas or Houston and then on to San Salvador and finally to Guayaquil. I am disappointed and would like to see it go back to a one-stop flight.',\n",
       " 'LHR to KUL. Bag drop off took much longer than expected especially as we had already checked and printed our boarding passes. Full plane left about 45 mins late. Food and drink better than expected, as was cabin crew service and seat comfort. Friendly and efficient service. I suspect the plane might have seen better days given that the entertainment system was ancient - no games, small screen compared with the likes of Singapore Airlines, Emirates etc. Some cost cutting evident - no menus, hot towels, metal cutlery - which is fine by me.  Would be happy to fly with them again.',\n",
       " \"I am used to flying business class with the traditional big carriers when flying internationally (Air Canada, Lufthansa) so I was unsure what to expect when flying with Condor. I was headed to Nice to attend a friends wedding and had enough miles to get there for free via Lufthansa but was short a few thousand for the return. Condor offered a great fare for business and I figured because it was affiliated with Lufthansa it wouldn't be so bad. For the most part I was right. When I arrived in Frankfurt from Nice it took at least 20 minutes to get to the gate. Not a problem since I had a 4 hour layover. However there were no food options in the terminal (minus a duty free and some vending machines) so we had to exit the terminal and go back through security to get to an area where we could eat. Luckily we didn't have to go back through immigration. After eating we went back to the gate and were greeted with a long line. Unbeknownst to me or my friends we had to go through security again, before we could enter the actual gate area. There was no separate line for business class passengers and once through security, there was a Condor check in process that added another 10 minutes before you could actually grab a seat at the gate. Once in the gate area, there is a small store where you can buy water and chips but not much else. Not a deal breaker. We finally boarded and they let business class passengers board first. As we walked onto the plane I noticed that it wasn't an actual Condor plane. It was a 757 that belonged to Eastern (I think). It appears Condor rents the plane but uses their own crew. The cabin layout was 2-3-2 throughout. All seats appeared to be the same width but Business Class had more pitch. I'm about 5'10 and could stretch my feet out comfortably. Although it sold as Business Class it was more like premium economy in my opinion. The seats were not lie flat, but at the ticket price, I won't complain. I could tell that the plane was old and refitted. There was no entertainment system in the seat back which annoyed me. As we were taking off, I could really tell that we were in an old plane. I fly weekly for work, so I know a smooth take-off vs a rough one. This was a rough take off and the screen on the bulk head actually showed us losing altitude at some point. Can't lie I was a tad nervous. We finally hit 10,000 feet and things started to get better. The cabin crew came by and gave everyone in Business Class a portable entertainment system to compensate for it not being in the seat back. They were kind of bulky (think a portable playstation) but the movie selection was great and so was the quality. It was free for Business Class but I think there was a nominal fee for everyone else. The food selection was good enough. I wasn't expecting 5 star dining, but the lunch was tasty and filling and the cabin crew was very attentive and helpful. I fell asleep for half of the flight and woke up for the second serving which was also tasty and filling. All in all it was a pleasurable experience given the price I paid for my ticket. I would fly with them again, but only if its on one of their aircraft, and not one that they lease.\",\n",
       " \"Got delayed from PAP, missed the connection and rerouted via MIA then ATL back to AMS. Delta agent in PAP was very helpful and put me on the flight I asked for, then Delta bumped me up to Business (Delta One). The new Delta BC with lie flat seat is really good. Window seats are even isolated (no passenger on the side). It is surrounded by the next seat which makes it a rather personal space. Having typically a low expectation of American carriers, the upgraded Delta BC is surprisingly good. Dinner is simple and well presented, service is quick and just what you need for a 7-8 hours flight. Connecting flight was slightly delayed but transit in ATL, is actually relatively easy and straight forward (from flight A to B in less than 15 min). I know it's no Asian carrier quality, but it is definitely changing my perception of US carrier and Delta seems on the right track to lift up its service. Will probably fly them again. Only negative point is arriving late in MIA there are hardly any Delta agents around (It's an AA airport!), so rebooking and hotel accommodation was tricky to figure. The Lost Luggage staff were very nice in fixing this quickly\",\n",
       " 'First time flying Etihad and I was worried by the negative reviews. Crowded airplane but I found the FAs attentive, service was good and timely. Food was ok. Late departure but they made up time on arrival so I was able to make my connection. Would fly them again',\n",
       " \"Seattle-Shanghai. Good connections with Alaska Airlines. But Shanghai Pudong airport is poor due to airport not being a hub for Hainan Airlines, they didn't use airbridge and a bus required a bus to get to the plane. The food is of higher quality than Air China, Air Canada, and most North American airlines. Cabin and bathroom cleanliness, and friendliness of cabin crew are also much better. Economy seats are average, with knees touching the seat in front.\",\n",
       " 'Good flight BOM to BHO and return. Flights all on time. Food on these small sectors is an awful roll which Jet needs to change. Coffee on Jet has got to be the worst I have drunk. Staff and crew are polite and efficient and the flights were on time.',\n",

       " \"I flew from DXB to FIH via NBO. Terminal 1 in Dubai is really getting old, and the check in can get quite slow. We boarded on time and took off a bit late. Almost all male crew served a snack on the brand new Dreamliner and breakfast before landing. The transit in NBO is very quick and efficient. The regional product of KQ is excellent, personalized IFE great food for 3 hour flight and great pitch. Europan airlines don't even come close on medium haul flights. They deserve that 4th star.\",\n",
       " \"I have been flying KLM for the last 5 years, approx. 20-30 flight per year. The aircraft are getting on a bit however they are upgrading some interiors which makes a difference and I believe new aircrafts are coming in for long haul late 2015. I find Schiphol good with always something to do. KLM allow short changeover times so you don't have to hang around the airport for hours on end. The flights have been on time bar one recently. The staff have always been fantastic both on board and on the phone. I often need to change my flights at the last min and they have always accommodated unlike BA who want to charge you and give you a terrible seat etc. \",\n",
       " \"Lufthansa had a cheap offer for their newly introduced premium economy. Even though I used to prefer airlines with a stop-over we used LH direct flight due to the short travel time. The newly launched connection FRA-KUL is really worth the extra money. Lufthansa is clean, efficient and friendly. The seats were very comfortable, screen was big and food was ok. I slept for a straight 8hr and my wife slept 9.5hrs. We were really pleased with the service and comfort of this new connection/product. I haven't been a big Lufthansa fan in the past but this somehow changed my mind. We will come back.\",\n",

Hardware wise, the seats were comfortable and the IFE was okay. There was a choice between beef and seafood. I chose the seafood and it was quite good. Luckily they still have the refreshment service 2 hours prior to landing. Service wise, the cabin crew were courteous and friendly.',\n",

Three times I have flown Norwegian to Tromsoe and every time my luggage has had to be sent after me on a later aircraft than the one I have been booked on. The turnaround time in Oslo is too short, and staff in Oslo appeared to be very used to this happening. When I booked the flight for 7th July I specifically asked about this and was assured that it would be ok. The delayed luggage is extremely inconvenient, and has created difficulties for myself and my family.',\n",

       " 'Well organized boarding by seat rows and friendly ground staff. Cabin crew was professional and friendly but never saw them smiling during the entire flight. Because of the short flight time there was no on board food and drink service, which was fine. PA announcements were very fast and monotonous so you needed full attention to understand. The plane did not have any kind of IFE. In general I was satisfied with the service offered.',\n",
       " 'I flew from Tirana to London via Rome and in general I was quite happy with the experience. Flight from Tirana to Rome departed on time at 5.45 am. Although it was a short flight of only an hour we were still served snacks and drinks. Same happened from Rome to London City Airport, where I flew on an Embraer plane. On the return flights, due to the whole plane being full, I was forced to book first class, which was actually the first time for me. London-Rome we were served Italian bread with prosciutto and some ice cream. Same from Rome to Tirana. Cabin crew were kind and polite on all four flights. When I entered the Rome-London flight, my seat was dirty and sticky but a cabin attendant cleaned it immediately. I was happy overall.',\n",
       " 'Jakarta (CGK) to Tokyo (NRT) in  July. Being seated in the economy class, I was impressed with the service quality and facilities on board. I am 6ft and found the seat is comfortable with sufficient width and leg room. It was beyond my expectation as I had been viewing some complaints on the seat. Plane is new, has modern and efficient design. What impressed me most is the hospitality and attentiveness of the flight attendants. No wonder they earn the 5-star airline status.',\n",
       " 'Both flights on time, aircraft appeared to be well maintained. BA should be commended for retaining 9-abreat seating in the 777, legroom is adequate and adjustable headrest is a nice touch. AVOD was decent, with clear screen, though movie selection was not extensive. Catering was marginal on the outbound flight from Atlanta, with breakfast \"croissant\" being inedible, however, much better on the inbound flight from London. Cabin crew were professional, but utterly aloof, interacting with the passengers without the slightest hint of warmth. Not allowing seat selection until 24 hours prior to the flight (without paying extra) is a negative, in my opinion.',\n",
       " 'Outbound flight to Athens was on time, but return flight delayed by almost 2 hours. Due to an equipment change the return was on a B767, and I was seated in the premium economy cabin, which was definitely more comfortable, and had the added benefit of AVOD, which is unavailable in the usual A320. I was pleasantly surprised to be served a warm meal on both sectors, which is more than I was expecting on an intra-European flight. Crew were professional, but not particularly helpful or engaging.',\n",

In the CS lounge they provide tablet devices as a portable entertainment system which helps to kill some waiting time. Similar devices are now also handed out on short domestic flights with small aircrafts (business class w/o IFE). The CAN-MEL flight itself was decent with regular drinks run and average food options. Seats were comfortable enough to sleep in. Cabin crew were pleasant and attentive with keen eyes for details. IFE movie choices were limited and could use some updates. All in all still a good 10-hour flight experience.',\n",
       " 'I was warmly greeted on entering the aircraft. The service was excellent, always with a smile. However, the cabin was very warm and noisy (we were seated over the engines). My wife had a window seat while I had a middle seat. EC is worth the money. I purchased a snack box which was just enough to keep away hunger pains, but nothing to brag about. The WI FI did not function until 2 hours into flight. However, Delta is certainly better than their competitors.',\n",
       " 'We left Kuala Lumpur on time on our flight to DXB. The aircraft was slightly cold, and had no wifi. As it was night time most went to sleep, I went to sleep for a few hours.

       " 'On JFK-NRT route Japan Airlines upgraded their B777-300ER and B787 seats to SkySuite, which offer surprisingly generous space and big screen (10 inches). I was very satisfied with everything including cabin crew service, flight meals, seat pitch, but only except inflight entertainment system, movie selections to be specific. The movies were a little bit outdated with limited western selections, but would be ideal for Japanese passengers since half of the movies are Japanese. JAL used B767 for its NRT-PVG route, and most passengers appeared to be Chinese tourists traveling with kids. The boarding process was a bit chaotic and the flight was full. The A/C on this segment was outrageously strong, and I was frozen sitting on a window seat. The flight attendant was very considerate after I told her this problem. Again, the cabin service was excellent; meal was good, but the inflight entertainment system was a bit old but still acceptable. I would definitely fly them again, for its top-notch service. JAL definitely deserve a 5-star rating.',\n",

KLM  service is top notch and their cabin crew know how to handle situations very well. ',\n",
       " 'Great service from a great little airline operating on behalf of Flybe. The Dornier 328 is a comfortable aircraft, albeit a little small.

In fact, the outbound flight only took 31 minutes, a record according to the crew.',\n",
       " \"Check-in and boarding were efficient. On board it was a fresh looking A330 with new Business Class seats. These are an improvement over the older angled seats but they are inferior to pods found on other carriers. In the fully flat position there is little space for your feet and overall, the seat is narrow. Flight left late due to congestion at FRA and arrived slightly behind schedule. The service was fairly attentive with FA's smiling throughout the flight. The appetizer was delicious but my lunch selection was overcooked and was quite bland. There were a wide selection of spirits and drinks to choose from and the wines served were fairly good. Pre-arrival meal was tasty and the portions were quite big. The IFE had a poor selection of movies and lacked in the number of new releases for both movies and music although the Bose noise-cancelling headphones were a nice touch. Upon arrival luggage was delivered promptly topping off a good experience.\",\n",

I recommend Malaysia airlines.',\n",

The A340-600 is not a comfortable plane in business, but the food was outstanding, more like a Michelin Restaurant than a plane. The plane A7-AGC, was a little tired, IFE a bit hit and miss. The A330-200 from Clark to Doha had the new business class seats, fully flat unlike the outward journey. The food was excellent again. Has Qatar changed its chefs in the last two weeks.

Our return flight actually left a few minutes early and arrived back home 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Again, the staff were very helpful and friendly. Sodas, juices, water, coffee/tea, and wine were served at no charge. Beer and mixed drinks were offered for an additional charge. Snacks were offered at an additional charge. They also served a hot bistro pastry at no charge that was only so-so but hey, this is airline food not a 4 star restaurant. We did not choose the elite service but they do board elite passengers first, from a separate line and they are seated first at the front the aircraft. Would I fly Sunwing again? Absolutely!',\n",

Flight from Brussels to Rome departed on time and arrived ahead of schedule in Rome. Flight from Rome to Brussels departed with delay but that was due to the chaos on Rome Fiumucino, but landed on time in Brussels.

Their A320 is in excellent shape, clean and well-kept, including IFE with dozens of programs at every seat even on short domestic flights. Nice leather seats. Seat pitch is reasonable. Flight attendants look sharp and professional. On this short domestic flight, refreshment is coffee or juices. I paid about $80 for a one-way one hour flight with a 7-day advance purchase. ',\n",
       " \"Flew return AKL-HKG-AKL. The seat was lie flat and comfortable, but a bit claustrophobic because it's rather narrow. Window seats also face the aisle, which is a bit of a bummer. And the A340 seats don't have quite all the well thought out nooks for personal belongings. Meals were very good. Flight crew were excellent. IFE was diverse and the system worked without much lag. \",\n",
       " \"CX's business class seat is one of the best designed. The seat is wide and spacious and can be configured with more or less privacy as desired. Tons of clever within reach storage space for various personal effects. Add in the usual very good food, excellent IFE and top notch in-flight service and you see why they're ranked consistently in the top 10 airline rankings.\",\n",
       " \"My second time on Copa, I knew what it was like so I had low expectations. As a Star Alliance Gold passenger I was able to use the business check-in which took less than 1 minute. The agent was not sure which lounge to send me to - I have a Turkish Gold Card. Eventually I chose the SAS Business Lounge, which is one of the better Star Alliance Gold lounges at O'hare T5. It has slightly better food with excellent views of the apron and runway. Don't use the Swissport Lounge. The fight departs on time. B737-800 has the interior almost identical to a United aircraft. It's an old plane - things are a little frayed and worn but not falling apart. Seat pitch is a little tight, comparable to US airlines. There was no IFE but drop down monitors every 3 rows and free headphones were handed out. On this 5 hour flight, dinner was served 1 hour after take off. There was no choice for entree, which was a layer of cheesy baked mashed potatoes on top of seasoned sauteeed ground beef with vegetables. It was quite good in fact but portion was small. Basic uninspiring salad, packaged dessert. As usual, alcohol is free (whisky, beer, red wine, white wine). Flight attendants served several rounds of water throughout the flight but there was no refreshment service before landing. No newspaper service, no hot towels. Flight attendants seem to be professional and pleasant. Overall it's slightly better than US airlines but far below Asian carriers in economy on comparable routes in both amenities and comfort. If you're able to get a good deal on Copa then I'd recommend flying it.\",\n",
       " 'Tel Aviv to Amsterdam - I liked everything. The seats are comfortable, the food was tasty and the staff were always available for requests. Entertainment also offered a good selection. I would recommend El Al.',\n",
       " \"The seats were comfortable, food edible and service very good, with the exception of one flight attendant. We were sitting near the galley and were fed up with his whingeing to the other cabin crew. He practically threw a drink at me and sneered at an elderly passenger's requests. He really stood out for all the wrong reasons as the rest of Emirates crew were great. \",\n",
       " 'AKL-HNL on a modern A330 in Extra Comfort seat in 11A. An excellent option at a small cost for the 9 hr long overnight flight. Whilst the seat was the same as Economy Class and the armrest was fixed, this row is situated directly behind Business Class in a small intimate cabin at the front of the plane. The leg room was huge, improving comfort and thus the ability to get some sleep. Return HNL-AKL afternoon flight was in standard Economy seat 18A and whilst a little tight when the person in front reclined, it was perfectly adequate and comfortable. On-demand movies / TV series / games were free and it was fun to watch some Hawaii-centric shows. The touch screen was not very responsive and there was no alternative controls resulting in a lot of unnecessary \"poking\". Upon embarkation, FA\\'s handed out amenity kits comprising eye masks, headphones, earplugs and in Extra Comfort seats additional items were included in a cute little pouch. Food and drink service was prompt after takeoff and I think relevant to the time of travel. A snack pack was offered at midnight with a breakfast before arrival then on the return a hot chicken/rice dish at late PM takeoff with a sandwich as a late supper. Much better than a curry at 3am as I have experienced on some airlines. Service friendliness and professionalism was mixed depending on which crew member attended you (as always) and the return was much better but overall more than adequate. Water was offered frequently throughout the flight. My only negative would be the temperature of the cabin - it was freezing cold! The FA\\'s were even wearing cardigans. And the complimentary blanket smelled like it had been in a smokers zone - it was disgusting. Fortunately I had packed my own. Overall I was very impressed with the flights. It represented good value and the inclusion 2 checked bags in the fare was a bonus. I would recommend this airline for this route and will fly with them again. It\\'s a shame Honolulu Airport is their hub - it is woeful and not a pleasant experience.',\n",
       " \"Was rung at 1840 saying your flight is delayed and you won't make your connections. Get to the airport and see the duty manager. Problem - Bangalore Airport is about 1hr away, so asked the phone agent to persist and find out how to change. The thought of a night at Chennai didn't excite. Eventually said I'd been put on a SQ flight at 2335, be there 4hrs before so grabbed bags and dashed. At the airport some confusion and they checked me onto an earlier flight to Chennai, uneventful but I just knew the bag would be left. It was. Horrible wait in smelly, cramped airport lounge only slightly better than an airport that smells like a WC. 2am departure on time and told bag didn't make it. Business class not worth it for the flight. Old seats, no foot space, didn't use IFE as tried to sleep for 4hr flight. Pleasant crew but incompetent ground handling. Won't do this one again. Bangalore-Singapore direct is more sensible.\",\n",
       " \"My original flight for my return to NZ was to Shanghai however due to Thunderstorms at Frankfurt the Paris flight was delayed and arrived an hour and a half late causing missed connection to Shanghai. Hope was given to us by the crew as they said everything was delayed and so we had a good chance but this was a false hope. On the Paris flight the English announcements were hard to hear as the sound was not turned up loud enough to overcome all those that had understood the German announcement and were now talking loudly. Attendants on Dubai flight were friendly and professional. There was mixed customer care when hundreds filed in to the customer service area. Some received overnight kits some received juice and water and some did not. The processing of people got faster when a second area opened up downstairs. Again mixed customer service. I got great service with all vouchers explained as well as clearly written on what was what as well as a meal voucher where as a lady I buddied up with didn't get as good service and no meal voucher. On return to Frankfurt airport the next day for rebooking great professional staff sorting out re ticketing of new flights. Accommodation was supplied in Frankfurt and also at layover on Dubai. This was fabulous. Overall my experience of Lufthansa is very good. I would fly with them again.\",\n",
       " 'Check in was quick and efficient. While boarding the aircraft an announcement was made for priority boarding of business class passengers and those with Star Alliance Gold status. As a Gold member I moved into the priority line and when checking my boarding pass the gate agent complained about me going ahead even though the announcement clearly allowed for it. Once on board the aircraft was in pristine condition. As it was not a full flight I moved into a row all to myself and had a very comfortable journey. The FA\\'s were not particularly friendly and performed the inflight service like preprogrammed robots. The dinner served was fairly basic but quite tasty. Flight left late but the crew me up for the delay resulting in on schedule arrival. The bags took nearly 40 minutes to come out and those tagged \"priority\" came out last. Overall it was a good travel experience but below the standard I have come to expect from Lufthansa.',\n",
       " \"The short flight from Manchester was very good, staff very nice, friendly and very helpful. Frankfurt to Johannesburg I was seated in Economy as usual, but just before take-off it was announced that seats were available in Premier Economy at the extra cost of 300 Euros. I asked a flight attendantif I could look at the seats before I committed to paying the extra money and she kindly took me through - I was delighted to see seats in this class were far superior to Economy. I agreed to pay the extra, was moved to my new seat and from then on my flying experience turned out to be one of the best I had ever had, it was brilliant, I felt that I was treated like a VIP. The flight attendant couldn't have been more helpful and kinder. I would defintely recommend Premium Economy to anyone. Thank you Lufthansa and your staff.\",\n",
       " 'As a frequent flyer I must recommend flying with Luxair. The planes are a little small and the price is not equal to a budget airline, but then neither is the service offered. Each time I have flown with the airline has been a calm and enjoyable experience. Staff are friendly and helpful. The food provided on the plane is tasty. On any occasion I have made a seat request upon check in it has always been made possible with absolutely no fuss. The security at the airport may not be very chatty but are efficient and it is to this day the fastest security I have been through in any airport.',\n",
       " \"Read mixed reviews about this airline before we travelled but for us it worked. We travelled Premier Class. Seats very comfortable, lots of leg room and attentive staff. Food was fine. Drinks at meals only but otherwise water was readily available throughout the flight. Blankets are really good! Check in at Gatwick for Premier Class could be improved - we were left to fend for ourselves which was not what we were told when booking the tickets as there should be a designated check in point which was not there. The only other thing which could be improved are the selection of films on offer. They could be upgraded and brought up-to-date - we'd seen most of the films which were quite 'old'. Apart from that, we would fly with them again.\",\n",
       " \"This was the first time since 2013 I'd used Oman Air and I would echo what some other reviews have said in that their onboard quality has begun to deteriorate and is showing signs of budget cuts. As always though the ground staff are excellent in London and Bangkok, check in staff are always friendly, welcoming and good to have a small conversation with. I used their online check in which is vastly improved since 2013 but at check in whilst chatting to staff I was moved to exit row seats due to my height which was very nice of them. On board the seat layout is still welcome as the extra space compared to competitors is felt after a few hours in the air. Even the exit row seats feel spacious in width with the wider fixed armrests. The little extras like menus, hot towels, and amenity kits no longer exist. Not major losses but noticeable. Meal portion sizes seem reduced too but the food quality and taste still seems better than competitors. On board staff are polite and professional, not quite as cheery or conversational as some other airlines but certainly everything you need on board. Muscat airport is starting to feel the weight of increased passenger numbers, I still like this old quiet airport but it felt very full this time and the transfer via bus to and from the terminal building is tiresome. There were problems with processing all the boarding passes for my flight and everyone was issued a new one with a new seat which made for an hour long queue to enter the boarding gate and a bit of a hectic mess on board with people wanting to move. For the price during summer and winter I think Oman Air is very hard to beat on this route. I look forward to using them again next year once the new muscat airport opens.\",\n",
       " 'Our flight started with waiting on a bus for over 10 minutes. In our seats (Row 11) the lights were not working. The movies start with long ads, and breakfast chicken sausage was hard. The sink in one of the toilets was blocked.',\n",
       " 'Not flown with Thomson Airways for quite a while so was a little concerned with the poor reviews. We flew premium cabin to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. From getting on the aircraft we were very happy with the service provided by the cabin crew, they were very helpful at all times. The aircraft itself was excellent, lots of inflight entertainment, very comfortable seats - we were on row 2. Food and drinks were very good, will fly the Dreamliner again.',\n",
       " 'Check in Cologne was nice and fast and no problem, topbonus number was checked. Boarding was nice and fast, we were welcomed when entering the aircraft. Flight crew informed about flight and cabin crew did a nice job. I got one coffee and a glass of water with a nice muesli bar. You can choose between salty and sweet, all of this is for free. Baggage at Berlin Tegel was fast and we arrived on time. Return flight was the same only the plane was a Bombardier propeler plane, which I like because seating is 2-2 and you can see more. Crew was fine again and this time I choosed salty and got a bag of prezzels. Since this was a small plane, we were bused to gate, but it was fast again. Air Berlin is a good airline and I booked again CGN-TXL-CGN with them.',\n",
       " 'Was worried that this would be awful but it was just fine. No issues, flight attendants were very polite, smiled and passed through the cabin 3 times during our 6 hour flight. This flight to HNL was better on Air Canada Rouge than the WestJet one we took last year. Could not beat the price.',\n",
       " \"One of the best airlines I have flown with. We flew from Riga to Frankfurt with Lufthansa, and then from Frankfurt to Verona with Air Dolomiti. The flight wasn't long, about 1hr 10 minutes. The flight attendants were friendly. I would recommend.\",\n",
       " 'I travel frequently with Air Transat in Club Class. The service is always great and the best part is the larger seat which is great for sleeping. The food is not always the greatest and the menu has not changed in the 10 years I have flown with them, but the early boarding and extra leg room along with a dedicated washroom makes this a pleasant experience.',\n",
       " \"Concord lounge was more business class then first. Boarding smooth, aircraft clean. Didn't like the seat much, B777 the seat is closer to the windows then the A800 which is more preferable for me. Crew professional, no WIFI, just repeat that no WIFI, food selection limited as they had a 'catering issue'. If I booked and paid for First Class I shouldn't have to hear they had a catering issue. I had the sampler selection without the wine coupling. The portion were small so had to ask for more food from a la carte, overall the food was not fantastic. Saving grace has to be BA cabin crew very polite and attentive.\",\n",
       " 'This the first time I have flown on Delta in 15 years, it was a short flight about three hours an early morning departure 6.50 am we arrived ahead of schedule, a very smooth flight with a very smooth landing. Our pre-order Muslim meal was delivered and it was a very filling and flavorful vegetarian sandwich. The cabin crew were very friendly and the entertainment system was very good. The seats left a lot to desire, a business class seat on flydubai was more comfortable which is a low cost airline, Delta need to look on upgrading these seats on their new orders from Airbus.',\n",
       " 'I don\\'t know why they call easyjet a low-cost carrier as the flight was definitely not cheap. Outbound - due to the early departure time I stayed at a Gatwick hotel the night before and used easyjet\\'s \"midnight check-in\" which meant the next morning I avoided the queues and went straight to security. I\\'d paid for a seat up front and had speedy boarding both ways. Despite it being a holiday destination, I didn\\'t find the overheads filling up too much. Very nice crew on both legs. Outbound we were pushed back and told we\\'d be delayed an hour. Last time I flew this route with easy we were delayed 3 hours. This is crucial to me as I had a ferry to catch once we got to Kefalonia and last time I had to pay ??00 for a private water taxi instead. With the delay and the non-reclining seats, my back was beginning to ache, probably not helped sitting next to a wide muscle man. Coming back we had a newer plane with thinner seats and bigger gaps between them. I\\'ve had bus seats more comfortable. On the plus side I had 2 seats next to me spare which has been very rare from me. This flight was delayed coming to Kefalonia and landing at Gatwick we were held up for about 20 mins. Bags took a while to come out. Overall, a satisfactory journey, but they need to drop the \"low-cost\" moniker and go back to being called a no frills airline as that\\'s what it is with all the charges you pay.',\n",
       " 'My trip from London via Abu Dhabi to Cochin with Etihad was very good regarding food, friendly service of staff and seat comfort, except my connection in Abu Dhabi almost failed. I was escorted to the departure gate in Abu Dhabi, which worked out fine and I caught my connecting flight to Cochin despite the 40mins of delay of my flight from London. My luggage did not arrive, which was not a surprise, with only 30mins layover. But it also did not arrive the next day and the day after, and so on. It arrived 4 days later when I had already left Cochin and I finally received it 1 day after my arrival back in London. The really annoying part however was that whenever I called the Etihad baggage helpline, I received mismatching information about the location of my suitcase. Overall the organisation of Etihad?셲 baggage lost and found left room for a lot of improvement. I would not dissuade flying with Etihad, but be prepared for unpleasant surprises especially on flights via Abu Dhabi to India. My advice is also to leave at least 2 hours layover for a connecting flight via Abu Dhabi.',\n",

No water offered. Flight was smooth, polite staff. Exit row seat was a consolation to no business availability. But it doesn't recline, for 5 hours. Food was beautifully made, with the whole Indian veg/non-veg. Basic drink/refreshment. Limited but good IFE with small screens. Three hours in had a medical emergency on board. Well handled.

Around 1/2 way through the flight the food cart came around, we were quite lucky because they told us each and every one in our family had $10 vouchers. In the end we couldn't even spend $40 on food!

Check in at Lufthansa at new Terminal 2 Heathrow at 06.00 in morning chaotic and lengthy - lots of passengers, too few check-in staff, check in equipment seemed not to be functioning well. Transfer at Frankfurt is complicated and long, compared with for example, Schipol, but better than Paris. All flights pretty full - but full compliments to Lufthansa cabin crew, very friendly and attentive given busy short haul flights. Complete punctuality. Also, a nice touch that pilot comes out of cockpit to say goodbye to passengers at end of flight. In contrast to Heathrow, check in at Barcelona extremely quick and efficient.

To top it off, there was also an inflight entertainment system with a fair amount of movies and TV-series I could choose to from, also for free no matter which class. This offer was avaible on your phone, tablet or PC, not on a screen on the seat in front of you. Their \"N\" magazine was also avaible in every seat pocket.

The flight was carried out by a relatively new and clean A318 which is still being kept in excellent condition! The flight cost 69 Euros (one-way), which is acceptable. There was a breakfast served, consisting of 2 croissants and 1 fresh danish pastry, along with some drinks of choice, including coffee, tea etc, even on a 35 minute flight!

Seemed like a snack service instead of a meal as it's too light. Seat was standard Eurobiz, but enhanced like a domestic US 1st class. But the ticket is EUR 250, only 15??more than economy, and in this case it was cheaper than full-fare economy. Wouldn't hesitate to choose them again for MAD-BCN on A330.

We had front row seats 10A and 10B, 10A window seat is reverse facing and 10B is an aisle forward facing seat, the seats were very comfortable and we got a solid 8 hours sleep. We were concerned that seat 10B would get disturbance from the galley and washroom which were in front of it, however, this was not the case and would recommend this seat, it also has no one stepping over you to get out of their seat, seat 10A gives good privacy if needed by raising the divider, but you do have to step over the legs of the person in seat 11B to get out, not a huge problem but sometimes difficult when dark. Very attentive and cheery cabin crew, they maintained this good level of service for the full 13hour flight. The food was just about acceptable, champagne was offered pre take off and during flight, wine selections ok. I would be happy to travel BA Club World again on this 777-200 aircraft in seats 10AB or 10JK, but I do prefer the Upper Deck on the 747, sad will be the day they retire the good old Jumbo, I'm not a lover of the new A380.\",\n",

Upgrading to business isn't a solution as there's no extra legroom on these planes. Have flown both Swiss and Norwegian in the past few weeks as well. Both had more legroom. Would recommend Norwegian (great airline - cheap, comfy, free wifi) but not Swiss (dreadful customer service). BA cabin staff continue to be very mixed : some attentive, polite and helpful.

The only drawbacks was getting through check ins on the flight back. We ended up being separated on the plane which, with me being a nervous flyer, didn't bode well. Also the queues for check in at Keflavik were rather long even though we were effectively just dropping our bags off. On the whole though, excellent!

Lately I have noticed that they do not weigh the hand luggage anymore and are fair with the weight.',\n",
       " \"Booked a round trip from BOS (Boston) to DFW (Dallas-Forth Worth) from June 23rd to July 9th. Before booking, I didn't read any of the reviews, but did check out their website and requirements for luggage. Between my 4 year old and myself, two personal items was plenty of luggage, thus not being charged any extra. I printed my tickets at home. Also brought snacks from home and a couple of empty water bottles to fill up once getting through security. I was incredibly nervous after reading reviews. Arriving at the airport like they suggested(a few hours early), I headed to the checkin counter just to make sure I didn't have to do anything special for my personal bags. A Spirit Airlines employee was helping people at the kiosks and took the time to help me answer my questions in a very polite manner. In Boston that day, there were thunderstorms heading our way and rain had already started to fall, making me even more nervous than before. However, the flight took off on time. No one was given a hard time about their bags and during the flight, the attendents were friendly and even got my son to smile. The only negative about the departing flight was that we landed 30 minutes early and unfortunately, had to wait said 30 minutes for the gate to open. Still on time though. The return trip, I arrived at airport a couple hours early and went to the gate that was printed on my ticket and my flight wasn't scheduled to be there anymore. Went to the next gate over and the Spirit employee kindly pointed me in the right direction without any rudeness whatsoever. The attendents on this flight as well were extremely friendly, even funnier and one of the attendents even played cars with my son which was really cool. On my return trip, I did not bring any snacks, but for $6.50 was able to get wheat crackers, almonds, cheese spread, dried cranberries, oreo cookies and a mint. Not a bad deal at all. This flight departed and landed on time. I can't say what the economy seats are like as I purchased Big Seats. They were extremely comfortable and had more than enough leg room. This also allowed my 4 year old to squirm, talk and be a kid without annoying someone sitting next to us. I will definitely use Spirit Airlines again as they exceeded my expectations.\",\n",
       " 'BKK-SYD-BKK Easy check-in. Received nice welcome as I produced my frequent flyer card. Decent legroom for economy and seat comfy. Food out superb. IFE ok, but not many films. Decent size screen. Plane had ample toilets including 6 at the back. Arrived Sydney ahead of schedule. Return trip pretty much the same though the food not quite as nice as outward flight. Offers of refreshment plentiful. To me Thai is a top quality airline so book with confidence.',\n",
       " 'Excellent service in PS. Seats were comfortable. Entertainment system was the best I have seen, and wish it were available on all United flights. Ground crew at JFK and LAX were courteous, professional.',\n",

       " 'Flew from Belfast to Gatwick, the plane was oldish and not very comfortable, I felt really squashed where I was sitting. Plane took off on time and arrived a few minutes early on the other side, so no complaints there. Boarding was relatively quick and the cabin crew were personable, one passenger complained of being ill during the flight and was attended to with care and attention. A hassle free trip but they do need more space between seats on their planes, this is a national airline, not a budget one.',\n",
       " \"The seats were huge and had sufficient legroom. A wide range of great movies to choose from. Seats were really comfortable and had a leg rest. Food was delicious, staff service was of high standard. I couldn't have asked for a better flight to start my holiday from HKG-HND. Will fly ANA's premium economy again when I have the chance.\",\n",
       " 'Recently flew BA from LHR to ORD, 64A, Upper Deck in Club World. Excellent experience with great service and a good food selection too. The crew were professional and very attentive but the ration of crew to passengers hels as there are only 20 seats on the upper deck with two dedicated crew. The seat was comfortable with plenty of room and storage under the windows was a great help too. The inflight entertainment was OK but the selection was very limited compared to what it used to be, BA could do more to add a much wider variety to its film selection, otherwise a great flight.',\n",
       " 'Flew First Class 2A from Chicago to London, easy boarding and excellent service provided at all times by the cabin crew in First Class. The food was excellent and a good selection available too. Breakfast was good with a nice selection with plenty of organge juice and tea which came in a pot which was a lovely touch. If you are flying British Airways and connecting from an American Airlines domestic flight do note that you can now transfer from T3 to T5 at Chicago airside by shuttle bus which runs every 30 mins thus avoiding the security lines in T5, this applies only to BA Passengers tranferring from an American Airlines or American Eagle flight to a British Airways flight.',\n",
       " \"This is a no frills airline as you know. But you get what you paid for. The seats were not comfortable, during the 3 hours that we were in the air that's the time I slept, Secondly the FA's were very chatty (they were chatting loudly) and the plane was not clean. However, I still recommend because it was very cheap.\",\n",
       " \"Last month, I traveled from JFK in New York to Milan, Italy. I only have good things to say about my experience. First of all, the plane was huge and the seats were comfortable. The food was great, the staff were helpful. There was a huge selection of free movies and music to watch and listen to during my flight. I also happened to leave my handbag on the plane on my way to Milan and I was sure that I wouldn't get it back, but as I was checking in my luggage, a flight attendant approached me with my handbag, asking if it was mine. I was pleasantly surprised. My comment is that on my flights to Milan and back, the wifi and internet did not work at all, but the movies, games, and music on the TV screens worked perfectly, so this didn't impact my experience that much. \",\n",
       " 'Excellent, the first class private cabin offers mini bar, snacks, pyjamas, good amenities, excellent staff, amazing food. The new Dom Perignon rose is a really good idea. Had a very good sleep on a comfortable flat bed with plenty of space.',\n",
       " \"I flew my family of 8 in economy on Ethiopian Air July 2 2015, IAD-ADD-JRO and back on July 12th. 777-300 on the ADD legs and 787's on the JRO legs. I have nothing but compliments on the aircraft, cabin staff and the overall experience! Much better service on all four flights than on most domestic carriers and they were pleasant. The cabin did get a little messy on the way back but what do you expect on a 17 hour flight? I would have no hesitation taking EA again or recommending to someone.\",\n",
       " \"Etihad has come a long way since my last experience with them back in 2013. My recent flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi was on the new A380 aircraft. It's fantastic and includes all the modern features you'd expect incl. in-flight wifi and IFE with touch screen. The service in Business Class was definitely worth every penny, from the friendly service of the multicultural cabin crew to the well prepared menu to the spacious massage seat. The bar area located between the first and business class lounge was a neat touch and I was able to indulge in a few liquors and wines only exclusive to First Class. After the flight, one of the flight attendants was kind enough to give me a quick tour of the first class area incl. the Residence. \",\n",
       " \"I was unsure of what to expect with EVA Air, however I was greatly surprised. The lounge has a brand new feel to it, not just in equipment but also in design. It's very modern, with some intense lighting. It's very comfortable, food was fresh and the massage chairs were brilliant. The flight, 12 hours of Business Class bliss. The seating arrangement was one that offered space and comfort, the LCD Screen was HD and had a great range. The staff were friendly, attentive and polite. The food was very tasty, the alcohol (I had red wine and water only) was a brilliant drop from Australia. \",\n",
       " 'Flew with GA334 on 16 July. Bad luck for me, I got Boeing 738 without IFE. Crew served hot meal, although the flight under 2 hours. It was pleasant flight.',\n",
       " \"Flew Perth - KL (return). Both flights were good, nothing remarkable or special. Seats were fine, legroom somewhat tight but there was good recline. Food was good by airline standards. IFE is a bit of a let down compared to Cathay - touchscreen was often unresponsive (although can be circumvent by using the remote), choice of movies was healthy, but limited - although there were some that did catch my eye. Cabin crew were courteous and professional except for one time where I noticed a cabin crew instructing a passenger on how to use infant seatbelts during the screening of the safety video. Other than that, I'm a satisfied customer.\",\n",
       " 'My first time on Qantas, quite a pleasant flight, flight attendants were professional, comfort of the seat is fine with flat bed. Good entertainment program. Amenities offered are a bit simple but overall the experience was good. The only bad point is that the seat is very narrow seat for tall guys.',\n",
       " 'First time flying with them and had never heard of them. First class treatment from all staff, food and drink good and economical, attention to detail for disabled passemger. Only delays were at the other end but kept informed at all times.',\n",
       " \"FNC-LIS-PRG-BUD-LIS-FNC. TAP privatization seems to have introduced some improvements to the company's general lack of customer service. Cabin crew was very professional, the food served was varied, in reasonable portions and good quality. Flights departed almost on time. I would advise that you check in online and choose your seat at the front of their aircrafts as these ones have larger legroom.\",\n",
       " \"Flew to CDG to SAW with B737-800 TC-JFF (has the old livery). Flight was at 19.15, but at 15.00 I learnt that (via Turkish Airlines smartphone application) the flight was delayed by an hour. I couldn't arrive at the airport until 50 minutes before the flight. Even though the check-in counter closes an hour before the scheduled departure, I was able to hand in my luggage (I'd checked-in online). Pushback was at 21.10, and no explanations were made about the delay. At the beginning of the flight, Turkish delight was served. At dinner, either meatballs or chicken could be selected. I chose the meatballs, and it was delicious, and extremely hot for an airline food. I was able to listen the newest Euro Hits by using the in-flight radio. (Even though the playlist consisted of only 20-25 songs). The plane landed to SAW at 01.20, with a delay of 1 hours and 40 minutes. Apart from the delay, I had no problems.\",\n",
       " \"Flew to SAW to CDG via Turkish Airlines with B737-800 TC-JFD. On-line check-in worked really well, and I was able to hand in my luggage pretty fast. Legroom was more than expected for an economy class seat. Food was almost as good as what you'd expect at a restaurant. Hot/cold beverages were served throughout the flight. As a means of in-flight entertainment, there was nothing but in-flight music. Not-so-high quality earphones were distributed at the beginning of the flight, and the system lacked variety. Various films/series were played on the on-board screens, I wish it could be possible to see the location/speed/altitude of the plane. Announcements made by the pilot/first officer in English were fairly incomprehensible. To conclude, by paying the same money, I flew with a premium airline instead of a low-cost airline. I'm glad I made that decision.\",\n",
       " \"A very enjoyable flight in Business Class from YVR to SFO. We had priority check in, which was great as the economy queues were really long, thus we were given much more time to spend in YVR airport. However, I was a bit disappointed that Business Class passengers didn't have a priority security check lane in YVR. The seats were wide and legroom was great for a 2.5 hour flight. We were served a pre-takeoff drink and then a two course meal, which consisted of mushroom soup and a beef salad/egg chicken sandwich. The cabin crew were friendly and I couldn't really ask for more on this flight. We had Personal TV's on the flight and a wide range of newly-released movies. Wifi was available but I did not use it. We had 4 checked bags and they were one of the first to come out due to priority baggage, and helped us make use of our limited amount of time in San Francisco. I will definitely fly this route again on Business Class with United.\",\n",
       " \"Flew down to Louisville from Anchorage with a stop at ORD on the way. Bumped up to First again which was nice. Crew was great, plane clean and on time. I found nothing to complain about and arrived relaxed and pleased with the service. O'Hare airport in Chicago was a zoo. It was as crowded and noisy as Atlanta always seems to be. I went to the American Admirals Club and mellowed out for a few hours - fine service there and the views of the aircraft was a plus. Flight to SDF on American Eagle was fine - the E-175 they use was quite a nice aircraft for this short trip, great views from the large windows on board. The return trip back to ANC began again at SDF to ORD, same plane as above, fine service, nice crew etc. I was routed to Portland from Chicago this time. All went well, I was seated in economy and had no complaints. I purchased the movie viewer and was well entertained. Great service too. The flight to ANC was near perfect. Only problem encountered was that our luggage was about thirty five minutes late getting to us. I put in and received my 2500 free air miles for that issue. All in all, flights were fine, crews were great and on time for all sectors. I feel Alaska should move up to a 4 Star rating.\",\n",
       " \"Austrian has never really been on my radar but after my flight from Vienna to New York, I have to say I?셫 very impressed. Austrian flies a 777-200 on this 8+ hour flight and the seat and the catering were what impressed me the most. I took the individual seat by the window which is very comfortable, for it has table space on both the left and right side of the seat. When converted to a fully-flat bed it?셲 very comfortable - although perhaps a little bit on the narrow side. The IFE was also interesting, with a remote touch sensor to control the cursor on the screen. You could also use the touch screen. It was a simple system but perhaps that's why it worked so well. The catering was superb. Wow! They have an onboard chef that prepares (or warms) fresh, healthy meals. The antipasti and desserts were brought to you on a trolley, where you could make your choices. The rigatoni pasta that I had for my main dish was delicious. The best surprise was yet to come though. The coffee menu! With ten options I was completely spoiled. I ended up choosing the Wiener Eiskaffee ice coffee - espresso with ice cream and whipping cream served in a tall glass. Walked away very impressed with Austrian!\",\n",
       " 'Only 4 pax onboard in business Class, get personal flight attandants for this segment, and had a great experience breakfasting during this flight. Bit boring during flight waiting for Maghrib time, and FA helped with nice conversation. Food and beverages was great and tasty. Overall had a great experience.',\n",
       " \"We fly JetBlue about 3 times a year, and every time it's satisfying. The legroom is great in even more space, the television is great for entertainment and they actually give you something more than peanuts. Also, every here and there the flight is over two hours and you can get eat up's (which include cheese up, meat up and many more). \",\n",
       " 'Being the first time flying with QantasLink, I was eager to see how standards compared with big brother Qantas. Airport Check In and security was all smooth through Brisbane. It was once I stepped on board that I noticed me and my colleague had the worst seats possible on the plane. Row 25 (back row near the toilets) and seats E and F which had no width and felt almost prison like. In addition to this the Boeing 717 has tail mounted engines which made the flight quite noisy - especially when trying to talk or listen to the cabin crew. Would recommend people sitting in rows 20 and forward to avoid this issue. Inflight services by Cabin Crew were excellent. Great breakfast options and Drinks. Cabin Crew were constantly looking to top up water. No IFE made the 3 and bit hour journey drag on - considering we had read that iPads were offered on this aircraft? I think for the money paid for these tickets some IFE needs to be offered. Aircraft arrived slightly late which was confusing as we took off early - but the delay was not an issue. Modern interior on board and as usual and great experience with Qantas on their regional carrier - Qantaslink',\n",
       " 'Great flights - a la carte dining with excellent food. Lovely staff throughout and good comfortable beds when reclined! Transfer easy, lounge was lovely although not well signposted, weird queuing system at bottleneck area near escalators.

       " 'Singapore Airlines is a wonderful long-haul airline to fly. The legroom and footrest are great, the food was excellent and the menu was very nice.

       " 'Recently had a pleasure trip to Boston, Cape Cod and New York. Unfortunately before we left I broke my foot and was on crutches for the trip duration. We signed up for handicap assistance through Air Canada. They were our flight provider for every leg of our journey. I am so impressed with the service Air Canada provided. At every Check in, one or more Air Canada representatives were there with a wheelchair to transport me (with my 78 year young mom), to the next flight connection. Everyone who helped was courteous, experienced and efficient. It made the trip so much easier, and there were some very tight connections, especially in Toronto. Thank you so much for your outstanding service Air Canada. My only complaint is the new $20 baggage fee which is the only reason my review is a 9 instead of a full 10. I wish it did not exist',\n",
       " 'I broke my foot on my vacation and the entire flight staff were amazing. The cabin staff were very accommodating and helpful. They gave me the extra room I needed to elevate my foot, helped me walk to the bathroom every time I needed to use it and frequently checked on me to make sure I was okay - the pilot even checked on me to see how I was doing. I appreciate the kindness of the staff and would fly with Air Europa again.',\n",
       " 'Booked my ticket for $199/RT total, which included airfare, taxes, and 1 checked bag each way. You can\\'t beat that. The check-in process online was fast and simple, as was the check-in process at the airports. All staff that I encountered were very friendly. The overall experience was great and I will be flying with them again. Most of the complaints that I have read are in regards to \"hidden\" fees. If you read all of the fine print on Allegiant\\'s website, there are no surprises. This is an inexpensive no frills airline. You will pay for everything including carry-ons, beverages (yes, even water), even printing boarding passes at the airport. Also one thing to keep in mind is the checked bag weight limit is 40 lbs, instead of the standard 50 lbs with other airlines. This too is stated on their website. Bottom line, Allegiant is an excellent inexpensive way to get from point A to point B, just remember you\\'re getting what you pay for.',\n",
       " 'Flew Business Class. Excellent FA service as they offer so much food and drink on you one feels a bit overwhelmed - but it is better then being ignored. Decent seat that reclines to 180 degrees but I felt claustrophobic. IFE poor selection and service that kept cutting out mid way through the movies. On time arrival.',\n",
       " 'Very good staff and food. I booked a DO&CO Premium Cusine a la carte and it was extremly delecious! There is enough legroom for everyone (I think so). The plane was a little bit old, but inside it was very comfortable and clean seats, very good salon design.',\n",
       " 'Travelled in party of four with prebooked seating 4 abreast outbound, 2 abreast inbound. Cabin clean, well presented and tidy with good welcome. Not a full flight but approx 80% loading. The level of service from cabin staff was excellent. Service got underway quickly with full choice of menu and drinks available. Good, clear and short information from flight deck. Toilets were clean and tidy throughout flight. Lights dimmed two and a half hours into flight to allow rest with water rounds taking place by cabin crew. Good English breakfast served 1.5 hours out of JNB. Return flight good with attentive cabin staff and quiet cabin enabling some sleep. Food did not seem to be of such a good standard on this leg. BA on these flights provided excellent service and we were impressed. TV screens a little too small.',\n",

A big problem was the food, it was tasteless, oily rice with pork - a let down but the airline gets you from A to B comfortably. I then flew Xi'an to Chengdu, smooth boarding and check in, sat in seat 58A in the back, recline was a little limited but the generous eg room made up for this. Served a lunch box with simple snacks such as bread, pastry etc.\",\n",
       " \"BOS-CDG, overnight flight on the 11th July and code-shared with Air France. Check-in was done via the Fly Delta app and was simple enough, paid an extra 짙50 for exit row seats which I am conflicted about. On the one hand, a good investment to have some comfort (nobody thrusting their seat into your lap on a red eye) and it's good to be able to stake a claim to those seats without relying on luck, on the other hand they were right next to the bathroom so had to deal with people standing between my seat and the wall all night and there was also nowhere to store my bag. Boarding took a little longer than expected due to a group of very excitable French children coming home from a summer camp. They were very loud, boisterous and actually downright rude but the excellent crew put a quick stop to their antics once they were on the plane. Otherwise there were no delays. The flight itself was exemplary, the staff were attentive and wonderful. The entertainment system is well-stocked and of good quality, I also loved the genuinely entertaining and funny safety video. The food was adequate, although I wasn't a fan of the meagre breakfast. No complementary alcohol on a long-haul also struck me as a little stingy. Overall I'm pleased with my experience and would recommend Delta to others.\",\n",

Entertainment system was okay - enough to keep us occupied on the long flights.

Cabin crew were consistent with service, this is rare on DXB-Asia flights I have exerienced in the past. The flight was a bit cold, bring a jumper for Boeing 777-300ER flights because my returning flight from PVG-DXB on 13th July was also quite chilly. Flight from DXB to LGW was also good, however this A380 hadn't been refurbished as some of the others have, so the monitors were quite slow to respond to touch commands which was annoying. Overall 4 good flights, check in on the ground is good. I briefly used the wi fi on DXB-LGW flight but it was only 10mb free before they charge, it seemed quite good from what I could see.\",\n",

Inflight service was about the same as other premium Asian airlines. Food selection and taste was okay, movie selection was typical near new movies and a few classics, with screen size was about the same as competitors. A big plus was noise canceling headsets on the TPE-LAX segment. Seat for Economy was good, for Premium Economy felt a bit uncomfortable - despite more leg and thigh room, when reclined, our legs are hung at the calf. A foot rest would be a good addition. Amenities was ok - you get your toothbrush set, comb, and slippers. You can ask for eye covers, ear plugs and other amenities. Blankets made with quality material.

       " \"You get what you pay for with Wow Air. Booking is pretty easy online. I was surprised when asked to choose my seat and that charges were added to my bill based on where I sat. I chose to sit in the cheap seats $5-$10 on each leg. When I boarded I really didn't see a whole lot of difference between my seat and the more expensive ones up front though there may have been a couple of inches difference. The plane was clean and the staff friendly. I didn't mind that there was no entertainment. I brought a good book and read or napped the whole way. I had chosen aisle seats but still felt claustrophobic when the passenger in front of me moved his seat back. It's tight! I had read that food was extra and expensive (they even charge for water) so I picked up something at Logan airport on the flight over to Denmark. The problem on the return to Boston was that I had barely 40 minutes between flights once I got off the plane in Reykjavik. I couldn't spend much time making selections or using the lady's room (fortunately only a short line). And it was a 15-20 minute walk to my gate in Iceland. Speaking of Iceland, the only flight from Boston to Copenhagen is overnight and also stops in Iceland at 4am. This layover, unlike the return, is 3 hours long and the entire airport is closed and practically deserted. Even my gate wasn't open. If any airline is going to drop off people in the middle of the night the airport should have something open-or better, cots set up so we can sleep. It's a long time at an awful hour to be sitting and waiting. Being able to have breakfast would be nice. My only big complaint on this trip was that Wow Air doesn't have a desk set up in Copenhagen airport until 2 hours before the flight. You cannot get a boarding pass online but must go to the gate. The line queues up fast and it's long as the flight is full. And here's the problem-having been in the EU for 2 weeks I wanted to get a tax refund. The system is already complicated and designed to discourage this. But since you need a boarding pass to get the customs stamp I had to wait for Wow Air to open a desk. Once you get your boarding pass you also give them your checked luggage. Customs want to see what you have bought, not just receipts, so be sure to have it all in your carry on luggage. People who get boarding passes ahead don't have this issue as they are still in possession of their checked luggage. Once you have the customs stamp you then have to find the correct bank/agency for the refund. There are several. All this takes time and waiting in line and then you still have to clear security. So I barely made my flight out of Copenhagen. It's stressful and shouldn't be. I was at the airport 3 hours before the flight hoping to take care of all of this.\",\n",

       " \"I went out of my way to take the new Air Canada Dreamliner and it was worth it. Although the Toronto to Copenhagen flight is relatively short - only 7 hours - it gave me a chance to experience the excellent new product and service. Business class has a spacious 1-2-1 layout in what AC calls private pods. Private they are for you very much feel isolated from the other passengers, which I appreciate. I love the 787 big windows. It makes you feel more connected to the exterior. I also loved the new IFE with a great touch-screen product. You can view your menu and all your wines on the screen. Food was superb - this time had an outstanding chicken tikka masala. The sparkling wine though, could be improved. It's too sweet for my liking. As is expected today, the seat converts to a fully-flat bed. When sleeping, perhaps the seat is still too high up for sometimes when turning around I would hit the front console with my hips. I don't have big hips. What I also loved about this pod is plenty of storage space. It was worthwhile to fly via Toronto to Europe from New York, just to avoid the American airlines.\",\n",
       " 'Even on this very short 65 min flight from New York to Toronto, Air Canada gets it right. The Embraer 190 has a spacious 1-2 business class layout, with comfy cushy seats. What impressed me most is that we had a proper meal-service which I very much appreciated. This is very rare in North American skies these days. ',\n",
       " \"BHX-ORD-CDG 27th June. No major concerns or upsets but certainly much room for improvement. The online check-in was very straightforward (I appreciated the e-mail confirming that check in had opened) and there were no issues there. The outward leg from BHX to CDG was fine, didn't expect to be served a snack but the croissant was practically inedible and thrown straight in the bin. The organisation at CDG was lacking. There was a delay of 45 minutes on the ground with no explanation from the staff, then the gate of departure was changed to a gate that was already boarding a separate flight to Dubai, with the new gate's screen not being updated to reflect this. This caused a large rush of people and a lot of anger and confusion, and although the staff did make an announcement confirming the Chicago-bound passengers were to board first, this didn't feel like enough as a lot of people remained confused and unsure of what was happening. We were then delayed for a further hour on the tarmac, although we were kept updated by the captain regarding this. Seats were okay, food was okay, a good selection of entertainment but the quality of the screens is poor and the sets only designed for the headsets handed out so sound quality was abysmal on normal headphones. There's a good selection of drinks (including complementary alcohol) and the flight staff were friendly and attentive. Not the best trans-atlantic flight I've ever had, but far from the worst. Return flight (BOS-CDG-BHX) was also Air France but was code shared with Delta and Flybe, so will be reviewing separately.\",\n",
       " \"Acceptable, but cabin showing it's age. Seats are a little tight, but good recline. Overhead Flight Map and Inflight Magazine acceptable for 2 hour flight.

It would be better to stop serving rolls and replace them with a snack (peanuts, chips, ect) and soft-drink instead.\",\n",

       " 'The booking of our flights was straightforward. However, when we have paid to sit next to each other, and paid for the opportunity to book seats in advance, you would expect the seating plan for the aircraft to clearly show where all the toilets and galleys are so that as the paying customer we would have a choice as to whether to is near them particularly on a long haul flight, on this occasion British Airways failed miserably. The plane was new and the seats were comfortable and spacious enough, not the upper deck in ecconomy. However being seated next to the toilets was not the best location, particularly as we had pre booked the seats online. The service was excellent and the staff helpful and happy to be there. The gluten free meals that we ordered were provided although the breakfast could have been more substantial especially after an 11 hour flight. All in all a stress free journey which was comfortable.',\n",
       " \"Recently took several flights with China Southern. First Melbourne to Xian via Guangzhou, then Chongquin to Guilin, Guilin to Melbourne via Guangzhou. All flights were on time. I found them not quite as good as Cathay, but still adequate. The entertainment (personal) was quite limited for English but still had a variety of TV sit-coms/dramas and movies. Coming back a bonus was that even for domestic-international if you have more than 6 hours wait (we had 12 hours) they put you up in a hotel room for free including transfers even during the day. You go to international check in, find G17 which is opposite the G's for check in and they check your details and then escort you onto a bus for your transit hotel. Bonus. However the seats we had 51A, 51C coming back from Guangzhou to Melbourne, mine didn't recline and my husband had NO tray table. It was removed some time some how. We mentioned this to the flight attendant who said they would be willing to let him sit somewhere else to eat. Me, well too bad. Not the greatest help. So instead of the hassle he just balanced his meal on his lap. Not really acceptable. Shame as we would have rated this airline much higher if they had done the right thing by us and let us sit in seats that had all their bits working, like a table and a recline (it was an overnight flight). The seats were hard. Without our issues I would recommend, but they could do so much better at no extra big cost.\",\n",

       " 'Having heard lots of horror stories about Iberia long-haul, I was eager to try them given that the reviews did not match the quite satisfying experiences I have had with them on a couple of intra-european flights I have taken with them, and I was pleasantly surprised. It is important to understand that Spaniards talk loud and do not like to beat around the bush, therefore, it sometimes appears like they might be angry or aggressive, while deep down they are more than willing to help! Boarding was carried out in a very organized way. Standing at the door, were a couple of flight attendants welcoming passengers politely. Other members of the crew were helping passengers find their seats and stow their bags. Once airborne, kids received entertainment kits, and passengers got earphones if needed. IFE had a wide range of choices from movies to games and IB information, WiFi and GSM were available, but I did not try it. Meals consisted on pasta or beef, but flight attendants came around a couple of times in case anyone cared for more bread. Coffee or tea was offered. I asked the flight attendant if I could have another glass of water, he mentioned he was busy, but that once he was done, he would bring it to me. I did not wait for more than 2 minutes, he came back with an unexpected glass of water for me in the middle of his tasks! Another flight attendant was equally enthusiastic and happy to help. Overall, service was carried out in a professional and genuine way: no patronizing and no fake smiles. Really looking forward to my return trip on the A340-600!',\n",
       " \"My expectations were low for Saga Class because the price was half of what I would have paid for Business Class on most transatlantic carriers. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised. The good: Air France Lounge access in BOS was excellent. Check in was great. Saga Lounge in Reykjavik was excellent. Nice AF lounge in Frankfurt. I did a two day layover in Iceland which I enjoyed. The food was good to excellent. I preordered each meal. The lamb was the best choice. I found the crew to be very pleasant and accommodating onboard. The 'less than good': Remote stands in Reykjavik. Not a problem arriving, but leaving was very uncomfortable. They loaded and loaded and loaded folks onto that bus. We waited and kept waiting with the door open and a cold gale coming through. Seriously? They couldn't get another bus? Finally, the flight from KEF to FRA was full in Saga Class with Icelandair execs and their spouses. They were some of the most obnoxious, demanding, and rude passengers I have ever encountered. They got their luggage hand delivered in FRA before any other passengers. \",\n",

Online check in was hassle free and the Jet2 check in staff at both airports and the bag drop were pleasant and efficient meaning we waited less than 2 minutes to drop our bags both ways. Outbound flight was on time in a very clean B737-800 aircraft, flight attendants were pleasant and announcements from the flight desk were regular and informative. Our inbound flight was delayed 45 minutes but with a tail wind behind us we landed back at NCL only 15 minutes late which was no big deal. As with the outbound flight cabin crew were fine with my only gripe that the announcements from the cockpit were so quiet it was impossible to hear them. Aircraft was full for both legs.',\n",
       " \"MSY to BOS on 6th July. I was initially confused and frustrated by the online check in process - they assign seats upon arrival at the gate, and you can only reserve online if you wish to pay for 'More Space' seats in advance. Both the phone and Twitter operatives were helpful when I raised this with them. We arrived at the gate with about an hour to spare, gate staff could not have been more helpful. We asked to have two seats together and were told that this would be resolved once the staff had logged in. 15 minutes later, we were called to the desk and found that we had been assigned to More Legroom at no extra cost. We were delighted with this and the seats were very comfortable. We also loved the DirectTv and Sirius Radio live streaming to the aircraft, a unique touch. The unlimited soft drinks and snacks were appreciated. The flight staff were attentive and approachable. The captain coming out to make the pre-flight briefing personally was a great touch. There was an on-ground delay of an hour due to bad weather in Washington, but the captain kept us fully informed of everything that was going on and since they had the foresight to switch the entertainment on prior to take-off (why doesn't every airline do that), we barely noticed. \",\n",

The meal range was quite good and the food was barely recognisable as airline food. The seats were certainly comfortable enough. The only downsides I could think of was a lack of available movies to watch and there was no priority boarding. Other than these small issues, the flight was a credit to the airline. ',\n",

A lot of passengers were travelling in groups and had a lot of luggage. The queuing times were excessive - was just glad I arrived early. Others had to jump the queue because their flights were due to depart in 30 minutes. The aircraft left late and there were operational problems with loading luggage at Heathrow. This meant the connection time at Amsterdam was very tight.

Now that they fly from Edinburgh, I decided to give them another try, and I wasn't disappointed. From the minute we arrived at check-in, we were made to feel welcome. Similarly at boarding, the staff were attentive and wishing people a pleasant flight. On board the Dreamliner, the business cabin is superb. Each lie-flat seat is positioned so that it's like a little personal oasis, and is comfortable, fully adjustable, and with lots of little cubby-holes for your bits and pieces. You're also supplied with rather good noise-cancelling headphones, and an Armani amenity kit. These are waiting for you when you arrive, and they have different packs for male and female passengers. Pre take-off drinks are also served. The service on-board is impeccable - there's one flight attendant for four passengers, and the food is excellent. The menu is extensive and you can choose any items, as and when you please. The plane itself was smooth and quiet, and the attendants ensured that the toilets were always clean and well stocked. Despite a short 45 minute connection time, I was impressed by the new Hamad International airport, where we were whisked through security for our ongoing connection. I would thoroughly recommend Qatar Airways and it will be my airline of choice for future trips, even though Glasgow airport is more convenient for me.\",\n",
       " \"Good flight on first leg. Used the BA lounge in PHL which is underwhelming. Quick boarding and attendant was pleasant and proactive in our cabin. Served a chilled drink and towel and orders taken for lunch. They emphasise the fact that the meals are a la carte which means you can choose when you want to eat. The food was well presented visually but lacked flavour and I had to send back an over cooked chicken dish. There is a good wine selection. The seats on the 772 are spacious and are laid out in a 2-2-2 fashion. IFE was just okay, nothing special. They supply you with pyjamas, slippers, amenity kits and a thin 'mattress', duvet and pillow. I can't fault the service but the planes need a remodel in terms of the seat and configuration. The downside is the washrooms which in my opinion are no different from J class washrooms. The next sector was on an A332. Terrible seats, limited storage areas and no USB port! Again food was well presented but underwhelming in terms of what you pay for. All planes left on time. I would recommend this airline if the price is good for a C class cabin but interiors need upgrading.\",\n",

The 2 hour delay prior to take off was a long wait, but the captain apologised continuously and instructed the crew to continuously pour drinks, even the inflight entertainment system was on throughout.

Before take off, the crew even engaged in small talk with the passengers, informing us of what we can expect upon arriving in Maldives and some of the activities we could join. During the flight, the crew walks frequently to check on passengers but are never intrusive. Drinks were served throughout the flight (without passengers asking for them). Furthermore, honeymoon cakes were given for couples visiting the Maldives for their honeymoon.',\n",

Seat is fully flat but looks tired and worn out. Got the \"throne seat\" for 2 of the legs which is very nice but entertainment like Lufthansa is outdated.

The return flight on the A320 was about 70% full and left about 20 minutes late. Although the flight crew on this flight were not as friendly, they were still very professional. The meal was surprisingly good for this type of flight with excellent Portuguese red wine included. The check in at Lisbon was very professional.

Coming back, Dalaman airport was madness! Also, a woman had a panic attack on take off coming back and the crew were good in helping her. I've read these reviews and come to this conclusion though: if you're expecting a silver service, top class flying experience and are measuring Thomson against Singapore airlines, you're going to be let down. Massively. But, if you're realistic then you'll be fine. As I say, 6 foot 4, long legs. I didn't expect masses of legroom, I didn't pay for extra space. I was fine.

The entertainment system though is far behind all competition and KLM really needs to work on the selection they offer, as for the food - instead of the normal 3 choices other airlines offer, KLM only give 2 but the portions are very generous and the taste is very good. Where KLM excelles is in the service, they make you feel welcome they are warm and serve with professionalism and respect. I will always prefer them for their personal touch.',\n",

Check in crew were not picky over slight overweight of check in bags when they saw that we didn't use full hand carry weight (just a small bag each weighing less than 1kg) so that was good as I didn't want to lug a heavy bag around during transit. Would fly with them again.\",\n",

Food was plentiful, even to the point of over eating. We had a delay out of Philly due to rain, and with a short layover in Doha, we did not know if we'd make our connecting flight. Immigration was super fast, and they held the plane for us, though we literally got to the gate with 0 seconds to spare. All but 1 leg of our trip was about sold out, but the flight was not unbearable. We are in the process of booking our return to Phuket for 2016, and Qatar Airways is the airline of choice!\",\n",

The the light and cabin crew call buttons are a design flaw that Scoot have yet to rectify. Apart from that, flight arrived 15 minutes earlier and the cabin crew were professional and friendly. No doubt that Scoot offers very competitive airfares on this route and the overall experience was positive for an LCC.\",\n",

I do hope that the careless and somehow rude attitude of the cabin crew on the flight out of Athens was because of a very light load. Bucharest Otopeni airport is not a very friendly airport to connect thru, passport control was quick but the security check took some time since most of the domestic flights were scheduled to depart at about the same time and only one filter was opened. Crew on the flight out of Bucharest were much better though they could smile a bit more. They do offer cold sandwiches and there is the possibility of having beer, no IFE, seats on the Boeing 737 were ok with decent legroom but the ones on the Airbus318 were uncomfortable and less legroom. I would recommend Tarom only if you don't have any other choice\",\n",

The service on the flight out of Manchester was first class, the crew were pleasant and attentive. The food on board was plentiful and tasty and nice touches like the ice lolly and cloth to freshen up were appreciated. Lots of movies to choose from made the long flights much more bearable and entertaining. The leg room was adequate even for 4 of our party who range from 6ft 2 to 6ft 5, if no one reclines the seat in front, however if this happens it becomes a very uncomfortable long flight, which unfortunately happened to my son who is 6ft 4 but these are the chances you take if not paying for extra leg space.

Only complaint was that the departure time was changed at some point after booking without notification from 6.30 am to 5.30 am and I did not discover until I went to print our boarding passes a few weeks before the trip. But, still worth it considering the low-cost 60 euro/ticket cost for the non-stop flight, which included assigned seating and 1 check-in bag. I'd fly with Vueling again.\",\n",
       " 'As a UK expat, I\\'ve done this route (YVR -LHR) dozens and dozens of times and have now taken the ridiculous step of flying via Calgary or Edmonton instead of taking the direct flight as the new \"High Capacity\" configuration on this route is outrageously bad. Even with Altitude status - so I can get a bullhead seat - the direct flight has appalling seat width and recline. Adding in extra economy rows so a few \"Premium Economy\" seats (is that a joke AC? ) can be jammed into this flying nightmare makes the matter worse. The 3-4-3 seats per row is a fine example of pure greed. Even the new business configuration is dire - what was wrong with the pods? I much prefer them to this arrangement.  My advice: take a connecting flight on a different plane type with a sensible seat configuration. Inflight meals, entertainment and staff are usual AC standards - nothing special but getting better. I\\'m usually asleep most of the flight so I\\'ll defer to other passengers for more details on this aspect.',\n",

Seats comfortable with plenty of space for the 2-hour flight. Food and beverage selection was extensive. Excellent snack of pasta with marinara sauce, beans, along with with a salad which was fresh.

On my way from Amsterdam to Rome, I had an Alitalia flight number, but the flight was operated by KLM and they had great sandwich options onboard.',\n",

After check-in, I was escorted to the front of the TSA Pre-Check Line and was done with security in two minutes, although I wish the agent was more jovial. Flagship Lounge great with plenty of breakfast options and an extensive beverage selection. The lounge was not crowded. Seating was comfortable and WiFi was fast. Overall, a great space with much better food and drinks than the regular lounge. Flight was good. Seats were spacious with tons of storage. Power ports, USB plugs, remote control and a bunch of other features located by your seat. Seat was private, minor complaint would be the firmness, wish there were a lot more soft like the ones they have on the Boeing 767-300s. TV screens were huge, great interactive map with plenty of entertainment options. The purser was interactive and friendly, although they lack some finesse. She dropped my appetizer on the floor and constantly spilled liquid on my tray table.  Food in abundance, they also introduced a new menu that I got to try out. Appetizer, main and dessert were all good quality, although nothing memorable. Salad was extremely disappointing. It tasted and looked like leftovers from a prepackaged bag of salad and the dressing was oily. Overall, food could have been better although for a flagship route, American should step up their game, considering Delta offers excellent inflight meals on shorter flights. All in all, the flight was great. Excellent ground service, good service, great seat, although food needs some improvement.',\n",

We arrived at the Terminal, 4-5 hours before boarding time, just to be sure. We were allowed to check-in. However, upon arrival at our final destination (STL), our bags were not with the plane. They were not on any of our flights! As it turns out, our bags never left New York.  We thought that being very early for our flight guaranteed every detail to be fine, including our luggage. However this event was truly a disappointment.  I still would recommend this airline to other people, as my other flights were fairly average, and didn't go wrong like this one.\",\n",

Flight was smooth and the crew was great. Hong Kong to New York : Great food and drinks, legroom was enough. Toilet was clean. For an economy class seat was excellent. Entertainment systems were perfect (many movies, modern music, etc.)  New York to Hong : crew was more friendly, welcoming and at your service. At the airport, even though we were there 5 or 6 hours before our flight, the check-in kiosk was already open. The food was excellent. The two in-flight meals were very delicious. I requested some cup noodles for free and some juice. The toilets were clean. Onboard entertainment system was well-supplied with modern movies, shows, and music. The flight HKG to MNL was like my previous three. Food was excellent. I wasn't even expecting food because the flight was just a little under 2 hours. In-flight entertainment system was good (I was able to continue my tv show marathon of How To Get Away With Murder from the flight from New York). For a short flight, Cathay still provided excellent service.\",\n",
       " \"Bought tickets on Condor for $500 one way Calgary to Frankfurt. For the price I paid the airline met my expectations. Checked in online but the website is not user friendly and after entering data for 6 people was told system was unavailable. I chose the option of not paying to preselect seats and it seemed as if it was a scam to have me pay out of frustration with the free option. It eventually worked and we got 6 seats together. Condor doesn't have a bag drop option in Calgary we had to stand in the checkin line for 45 mins even though we were checked in. It was the first flight of the year from Calgary so once fully boarded we sat in the plane for an hour because the contracted ground handler didn't train their staff on condors systems. The pilot told us such. Once enroute the flight was fine. Entertainment was one free basic movie and then a small fee to access the premium content. Overall selection was mediocre. Dinner and breakfast were served and again the food was mediocre. Crew were fairly robotic and weren't overly friendly. One of our bags were lost but eventually turned up an hour later in Frankfurt due to a handling error. Overall you have to remember it's a budget airline and you get what you pay for. I would use them again.\",\n",

Within one click of the app, I was offered alternate flights, even alternate dates and airports without any extra charge. I was then rebooked to the nonstop flight departing an hour later but two hours earlier than I originally would have arrived. The agent at the SkyClub upgraded me to an exit row seat free of charge and apologized for the delay, which was minimal in the first place. The delay was handled extremely smoothly and I was rebooked, upgraded and taken care off within five minutes. The actual flight was good, on board a Boeing 737-900ER and despite being only a year old, the cabin was not properly cleaned and there was garbage on the seats. Legroom was excellent as there was no seat in front of me, although it was a bit hard to see the television - it was about six feet away, although DL was smart enough to put a remote control for these seats. Complimentary beverage served multiple times and buy onboard food options were decent. Flight attendants did their job, were quite friendly. Entertainment options excellent, with entire seasons of my favorite TV shows. WiFi was fast, although I recommend buying the 24-hour pass on the DL website or app as it's much more expensive onboard. Overall, a pleasant experience onboard but DL did a fantastic job handling the delay on the ground.\",\n",

Little monitors drop down from the ceiling with route progress but no entertainment. A pleasent alternative to the likes of Wizz Air, Ryanair or easyJet. Similar prices. Gatwick means not having to put up with the trauma of Stansted or Luton. Prague airport is quiet enough, albeit an odd security set up.',\n",

They even provided rice crackers rather than a bread roll. The meal was served just before the other passengers so there was no awkward asking if they had my requested meal.

When you're panicking because you've realized your wallet must have fallen out of your purse underneath the seat in front of you, and you just want someone to look for it, there will be no help for you.

The only potential issue, which didn't affect me, would be if you are a taller person. The seats are closer, but good options are to sit in emergency row, or big front seats.

I can tell you that the information you get from Spirit is spot on. If your bag is overweight, you have to pay more. You can only take one personal item on the plane. Yes, you have to pay for food, drink, a roomier seat. But-that is spelled out before you purchase the tickets. We did buy the zone 2 seating, and it was worth it. The seats are regular sized seats, but the knee room is a bit cramped. Nothing that was too bad, but I felt bad for a gentleman that was quite tall that had to put his knees in the isle. But he was happy and said he had flown with them many times before. I brought a neck pillow to sit on and found that very very helpful.

I am about a 5'9 height, so it was plenty for me, but for my partner who is 6'1, he had plenty of room to stretch out and relax. The service that was unparalleled, our flight attendant was exactly what her title states - very attentive not only for myself and partner but for everybody else around her. She was very knowledgeable in regards to food menu, beverages provided and even had held her own when another passenger requested for a specific cocktail, that she knew how to whip up. This caught the requesting passenger off guard, funny moment. The complementary Ipads being offered were a nice touch, not needed but it is always nice to have options, and flying in the J cabin with Air Canada Rouge was well worth it all. My only complaint was if you were sitting in the last row in J cabin, there's a curtain to section you off from the rest of the aircraft except for a hole between you and the person beside you, ie. the arm rest area, there is a large hole for someone from behind you to peep and see through, personally, it is a minor detail but I can imagine a person who has business or work to do would appreciate the complete privacy instead of having that large gap. That being said, the service and cabin was amazing, and is highly recommended for everyone to try with Air Canada Rouge.\",\n",

If you know the huge distance between terminal 3 and 5 at Heathrow, you'll know just how much effort the flight attendant put in to returning the handbag. That exceptional level of customer service is almost unheard of these days, so BA get a 100% customer care rating from my wife and I. Snacks were good given it was only a bit over 3 hours flying time. Aircraft was clean, however the only negative was the Business Class seats, in fact the tiny cramped seats was the only thing that BA should really change as it sort of killed an otherwise perfect journey. They were standard Economy Class seats cramped in tight so your knees were pressing into the seat in front. To convert these to Business Class seats all they did was put a fancy clip-in style armrest to make the row configuration 2 seats instead of 3.\",\n",

The service on this mid afternoon flight was as efficient as ever and the cabin crew were friendly too. It was a pleasant surprise to receive a hot cheese quiche to eat instead of the more usual cold cheese or ham roll. Of note the complimentary white wine was better than the wine that we had in business on the way down and it was cold. Coming down none of the cold drinks in business had been cooled down, so we had wine with ice cubes. Today there was nobody sat in the four rows of business class so it was curious to see the crew still pull the curtains across. Perhaps to keep the forward bathroom off limits. But all up Swiss were good and happy to fly with them again.',\n",
       " 'TAM Airlines from Guarulhos-GRU to Orlando-MCO. The flight, in general, was good. The food was good, so was the space between my legs and the seat in front of me. The flight attendants were kind. I would fly again!',\n",
       " \"I was worried about flying with Thomas Cook but everything went well, no problems at all. Staff were all friendly and helpful but still professional from check in to the cabin crew. The only thing is the size of the aircraft which seems to be designed to squeeze as many in as possible, I'm only 4ft 11 so I was fine but my boyfriend who is tall was rather uncomfortable so will need extra leg room next time.\",\n",
       " 'This was the first time I have flown with TCA and would definitely use them again. Price paid was very reasonable for a transatlantic flight and the quality of service and food was excellent.',\n",

Even the First officer came out to talk to him and reassure him. Got off plane feeling fresh and rested and no usual jetlag feelings. Brilliant all round.',\n",
       " \"Brisbane to Adelaide on TT317 departed 4.50pm (local) arrived 6.50pm (local). Yes they police and enforce the carry-on limit but it works and allows for quick turnarounds. I took advantage of their new cabin+ which allowed me to bring on board up to 12kg. As I had pre-booked an exit row seat I had to counter check-in rather than use the self-serve kiosks but there was no waiting and quickly processed by friendly staff. At the gate, carry-on bags were being checked ad-hoc. Boarding was efficient and quick which allowed for an early departure. The aircraft was spotless and it was great to have cloth seats rather than the faux leather of Virgin. Yes its buy on board, but a good range of drinks and snacks were available. Very friendly cabin crew and great communication from the flight deck. It was actually the first time that I was asked if I needed assistance to place my bag in the overhead locker. Seat comfort no different to economy on Qantas, Virgin or Jetstar and in fact it seemed that the seats were wider than on the Qantas and Virgin 737's. Since being taken over by Virgin, Tiger certainly seemed to have improved and as long as you follow the rules concerning check in times and carry-on limits they provide quality safe air travel at quite reasonable prices when compared with Virgin and Qantas. You have to ask for the majority of flights in Australia under 3 hours, is the extra money to fly Qantas or Virgin for a complimentary muffin worth it. While Tiger only operate limited flights to/from Adelaide compared to Qantas and Virgin, I will certainly be happy to look at flying Tiger again if the price and flight times work.\",\n",
       " 'US Airways Express. We arrived very early for an afternoon flight  and asked if possible to change to earlier flight. Customer service lady very kind and helpful - changed it to 11.15 am flight no extra charge. Boarding smoothly, small plane. Allocated 2 seats and prefer that configuration. Only 1 flight attendant with a good sence of humour. We were unaware that flight from Philadelphia to New York was only 19 minutes so quickest flight we have ever been on. Only negative is we prefer life jackets in case of emergency not flotation cushions on bottom of seats. The main thing is we arrived safely. ',\n",
       " 'My return journey was smooth and no problems, again the hotel for the stopover was good and I had a suite to myself went on the city tour. The flight crew on both legs of the journey were polite and attentive. The food was excellent and drinks plentiful.',\n",
       " 'I chose the Plus service, partly for the extra leg room and partly because everything is included - no nickel and diming. I have used this before and been reasonably pleased with the benefits, mainly since earlier flights were not full in the Plus section. On these flights however, there wasn\\'t an empty seat on the plane, either way and of course I had a very large \"companion\" in the middle seat. Really it did not feel much different from the regular economy, but at least I did not have to pay any extras. I note that Westjet are going to stop selling the middle seat. Too bad they haven\\'t implemented that already. I was hoping for some level of improved comfort for the extra money, but really I was just crammed in like everyone else. Food is the same as regular economy, and nothing to get excited about: limp sandwiches and junk food snacks. Wine was drinkable. On the return flight, the aircraft had no seat back entertainment, instead they were renting out tablets (much like AC Rouge). This was, of course, free in Plus. Choices on the tablet were minimal. All things considered, this service is preferable to Air Canada, who do not offer a premium economy on this flight. Air Canada do have full Business Class, but at outrageous prices which I cannot charge to my clients.',\n",
       " \"My wife and I flew AeroMexico for the first time this past June. We didn't know what to expect but were extremely pleased. The planes we flew to and from Cancun were new and clean. Screens at every seat. Great service from staff. kicker is that I somehow managed to lose my iPhone on the way back home. I thought it must have been at the Cancun Airport so I called them a few times to check the lost and found. Nothing. Then about three days after my flight I got a call from AeroMexico that they had discovered my phone on the plane. I hadn't even informed them that it was missing because I checked my seat area and was fairly sure that it wasn't there. Honestly I don't even know how they managed to figure out whose phone it was. They may have had to call multiple people in our area of the plane. Anyway I went back to the airport and remarkably, they had my phone. I was relieved and extremely impressed. Needless to say I would highly recommend this airline to anyone flying to/from Mexico. And they are linked to Delta so I believe your points will accrue as Skymiles. \",\n",

       " \"Recently flew Birmingham to Paris CDG. It is only a short flight which was good considering how uncomfortable the seats were. The seat was far too narrow. I'm not a particularly large guy, but this seat was way too narrow. We were served a sandwich and drink during the flight. The sandwich was revolting and served on bread. Ordinarily I like Air France but this service was poor.\",\n",
       " \"Overall, it was good. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful. The seat were fairly comfortable with plenty of storage space on the sides. The food and entertainment were fine. My husband's screen would not work at first, but the flight attendant fixed it in a few minutes. The cabin was clean. One of the seats did have a broken piece of plastic where the cup holder was. It could have pinched or cut someone. We were happy with the flights.\",\n",
       " 'The check in process was very poor in Guangzhou. I could not find a business class check in counter. I went to a China Southern enquiry counter and the first person there was too busy on the phone. The second person I spoke to directed me to the Premium Economy check in counter where I eventually checked in at. The lounge is poor and the choice of food and beverages was not good. The aircraft was spacious and clean. There is more than adequate space and a proper lie flat seat. The service was faultless with four staff in the business class cabin. What however lets the airline down is the food. It was pretty poor. The single toilet was kept clean during the entire flight. I had trouble with the IFE and could not use it.',\n",
       " \"AUS-LAX-SEA. I usually fly economy but decided to spring for first class as my traveling companion had never flown in that cabin before. It was nice to check bags with no fees! Boarding was efficient in AUS and it was a nice touch to be addressed by name. Boarding efficient and flight left on time. It was also nice to be offered a pre flight beverage, chose white wine served in a plastic cup. The first class bulkhead seats we had were spacious. Embraer 175s do not have ovens so lunch was a cold chicken orzo salad with an appetizer and desert served all at once. Many reviews indicate that crew was either rude or inattentive but my experience wasn't like that. The drinks were kept filled during the flight, food ample and tasty and the flight attendants were upbeat and social. Boarding in LAX was a mess as the gate was in the corner and no one listens when they tell you they board by zone. Once on board a pre flight beverage was offered and after take off they served dinner. On the LAX to SEA route, Delta has partnered with Luvo as part of upgrading food service in first class. The wrap and accompaniments were fresh and delicious. Drinks flowed and attendants were offered snacks and checked on customer needs.  I had heard and Delta and its regional partners have worked to improve service and food and I was not disappointed. \",\n",
       " 'The terminal in SEA was unbelievably chaotic as it was a mix of overseas, Hawaii and cross country flights. There was very little seating and the place was cramped. Good thing we only had to be there for an hour. The SEA to MSP leg was on an older 767 with upgraded interior. This was the domestic version so first class was billed as business and the seats was packed in a bit tight. In any case, once again, we had a great experience. Pre-flight drinks and lunch were served. My companion and I had the cheese burger with dill potato salad, sliced cheese with fruit and a piece of raspberry cheese cake all served at once. For a lunch, it was rather hearty and was very filling. The flight attendant was a bit stuffy but she kept the drinks coming and was still attentive. Gin and tonics I had were strong so I limited myself to two and then switched to white wine. The MSP to AUS was just as pleasant. My companion had the ginger beef and I had rice with shrimp and sausage. Again a slightly stuffy attendant but nothing to get into a fuss about. Seats had ample space and the aircraft, though a bit old but was clean. One negative thing that was consistent on both the AUS-LAX-SEA and SEA-MSP-AUS flight was trash in the seat pockets. I imagine it is easy to overlook the seat pockets as fast as they have to turn the plane around but I still think an extra minute or two and it could easily be taken care of.',\n",
       " \"Return flight KRK-BSL-KRK. I needed a cheap ticket from Poland to that area of Europe and this fulfilled my expectations. EasyJet is a low cost airline, so I did not expect any meals, snack or entertainment system. Price wasn't cheapest possible, but it wasn`t high either. Seats were low cost airline type, but the airplane wasn`t fully occupied, so there was a place if someone really wanted to change place. Flight wasn't long, so traveling conditions were completely acceptable.\",\n",
       " 'WAW to TPE and back. Journey was pretty good. I was little bit upset about DXB airport terminal 3. Maybe it was modern and clean, however \"duty free\" prices had nothing in common with \"duty free\". Good thing is that Emirates provides a free-meal coupon if stopover lasts more then few hours. During all flights the crew was very kind and professional, I was satisfied with their service. Meals were above average. Only one thing really suprised me  was the entertainment system in A330 flying DXB to WAW. Emirates is really proud of its system, but in that plane there were just few channels to choose instead of whole system. Moreover, quality of monitors was far from good. Very surprising. Emirates biggest strengths are luggage weight limitations, punctuality and professional staff. ',\n",
       " \"Return flight. I was very pleased and suprised about being served a good meal during such a short flight (2h 30min). Maybe it was not enough to fight the hunger of big European guy, but it was much more than I expected. There were also few music chanels. Planes maybe not the newest, but nothing to complain about. Service and cabin crew was ok. EVA isn't the cheapest one, but fortunatey for me, I found a really good deal 2 months bofre my planned departure. I was very satisfied.\",\n",
       " \"Used this airline for the first time June 19 for a flight between Subang airport and Kota Bharu. The staff on-board were friendly and I couldn't believe they served a snack and drinks for a 1 hour flight. The only negative point was that the back of my seat wouldn't stay in an upright position and would slowly recline back. Other than that, I was happy with my choice of airline.\",\n",

First flight was on time but my return flight was delayed about 45 minutes because of two drunk passengers who were escorted out of the plane by the police.\",\n",

Dinner was great, but breakfast wasn't great. The layout of the plane was quite good, and entertainment was good. On the returning flight home, staff were friendlier. I don't know if this is a cultural thing, but I just didn't find the staff very helpful or smiley, which is odd, as there is such a huge emphasis on friendliness for airline staff. Perhaps they were just having a bad day, which I understand. For the price of a return flight to Zanzibar from London flying directly to Zanzibar after a quick transfer in Oman, I would travel with Oman Air again. On a superficial note I thought the airline outfit for the staff was beautiful, very smart and the staff looked amazing!\",\n",

Ground staff checking in passengers  very professional. Boarding went okay and found we had seats with extra legroom. Gluten free meal and snacks given as requested, which I find good. Cabin crew seemed friendly and asked me to complete a survey. Los Angeles to Brisbane flight took off late due to being informed by pilot that passenger didn't turn up, so had to offload bags. My husband had to ask for power outlet for Cpap which had been arranged by special handling Sydney end - cabin crew thought he said extra safety belt, and she brought him that. Gluten free meal for me given and snack in a bag. Husband missed out on first drink run - didn't get asked. Just an observation of this flight as a passenger of other Qantas flights, that I noticed a big difference in customer service with American and Australian cabin crew - the teamwork appeared segregated. \",\n",
       " \"QF 23, 28 June. Flight was slightly delayed as departure was from a stand away from the terminal. The transfer didn't take too long and was reasonably efficient. The A330 was pretty comfortable even in economy. The service provided by the cabin crew was excellent. Drinks and food plentiful and a welcome drink and a bottle of water was welcome! The aircraft hadn't been updated and the inflight entertainment was showing its age in terms of screen size, choices and navigation.\",\n",
       " 'Both routes used the same plane. Service and food was poor out of Manila Clark, but DOH-LHR route food was significantly better. Only issue is that the A330-300 seats are not flat bed like the Boeing 777, very difficult to sleep without feeling you are sliding off. Ground staff were good in Clark and solved a connection issue. Both flights in business about 50% full. IFE was fairly average. No Pyjamas given out and quality of amenities gone down especially the eye mask.',\n",
       " 'After near perfect flights on the outward sectors to the UK, QR slipped up on the return. Having decided which movie to watch after lunch, not one of the new movies had been loaded onto the 787\\'s IFE system - even 8 days after the start of the month. I then looked at the classical selection of the music channels. These are distinctly second rate in terms of choice - and not all are classical. IFE is one area where QR can definitely improve. Prior to take off on the second flight from Doha to BKK the FA asked about meal choices, reminding me the meal would served on demand as is QR\\'s custom. I made it very clear I wished to sleep as long as possible on the 6 hour flight requesting merely orange juice, coffee and a croissant just prior to descent. We agreed this would be served one hour prior to landing. I was then awakened, raised my chair, threw my eye mask and ear plugs into the side bin as my orange juice was served only to realise there were in fact 2 hours of the flight remaining. The first comment was \"we are arriving early!\" which was not true. The second was that it was assumed I would need time to freshen up! Both inexcusable! On going to the aft toilet to change, the basin was clogged with filthy water and unusable. Then on asking for the complex landing cards required in Bangkok, I was informed they had not been loaded at Doha since they had had no stock for a week. Yet with 4 daily flights to/from BKK, surely the world\\'s best airline could figure out a way to get a stack of them back to Doha!',\n",
       " 'I was looking for an alternative to Etihad, with its high fares and declining service.

       " 'My 2nd trip with Spirit and I found them to be quite acceptable and actually quite comfortable. Yes they charge for everything, be prepared for it and adjust as based on your needs. I liked having options. As for the prices, if you want water buy a water bottle with a filter in the end have it empty going through security and fill it at a water fountain. One trip I had business materials and checked a bag no problem I weighed the bag at home to make sure I was under the weight limit. Second trip I carried on a \"personal\" item which was a duffle bag it worked perfectly. To go through the gate I put my backpack inside the duffle, neck pillow around my neck, and water bottle in hand - no problems. Both trips I paid for the Big Front Seat and in my opinion worth every penny! So there is a recurring theme here, this airline requires you to pay attention, read the contract of carriage and abide by a little different set of rules. After readign the contract for carriage I realized buying travel insurance is a good idea with these guys because they can and will cancel a flight and only refund your money. You pay for the\"last minute\" flight on another airline and use the insurance to pay the difference. I found the flight crew to be nice and helped passengers put bags in the overhead bins. The flight attendants aren\\'t supposed to do that.',\n",

Hardware-wise, I think everything was great. The food was good, seats were comfortable, and the plane was clean. The IFE could be improved further though. Service-wise, I would say Thai Airways is inconsistent. On all the four legs flown, I saw cabin crew from the the super helpful and friendly to rude and unfriendly.

Cabin bag the right size otherwise you will slow yourself (and the system) down - hold luggage meets requirements (32kg limit is the most generous of any low-cost airline I know). Check-in online, not at the airport. The ground-handling is low-rent and sometimes waiting on stairs is unpleasant (except once at Christmas when some passengers sang carols). This is one of the worst things about Wizz. But a bit better if you buy Priority Boarding. Flights often do not leave on time but may catch up in the air. The aircraft are modern, clean, and have leather seats.  I travel with Wizz Air frequently and I note small and steady improvements as time passes. I see a number of angry reviews of Wizz but I guess that these writers are not a representative sample of the average customer experience. Summary, it's okay.\",\n",

In spite of this disappointment I would continue to fly Air Canada.',\n",
       " \"If you investigate Rouge in advance, and consider this to be Air Canada's vacation tier product, I think you will be fine with the level of service and comfort. I have seen complaints about the premium economy seats on these flights - these are definitely not to be compared to business class. They are larger but still economy style seats (no lie flat, no pods etc.) I have status with Air Canada (which did not do much for me on this flight except for a faster luggage drop off.) I was flying with 2 other couples and a 1 year child, for whom a seat was purchased. Seat comfort: I upgraded to a seat with more legroom (Rouge Plus - not Premium Economy, just a seat with more legroom in economy). There was sufficient legroom for the flight - better than the Air Canada Boeing 777 with 3-4-3 seating which I will not take again unless forced to. I would not fly to Europe in a Rouge regular economy seat as these are very tight. A pillow and blanket were supplied as part of the seating without extra charge. I was comfortable enough to sleep. Meals: Dinner (Chicken, quinoa salad, one roll, some kind of dessert) or pasta (did not select) is included on the flight to Lisbon outbound from Toronto as well as a slice of banana bread about 1 hour before arrival. Two or three drink services (two on the overnight flight and three during the day). Meals are included on transatlantic flights - you must pay for alcohol and only credit cards are acceptable. Quality was comparable to Air Canada Economy class,  which is to say, barely acceptable, but edible and hot. Meal on return was chicken or pasta - quality of meal was better. Snack provided was a hot chicken or vegetarian wrap. Edible. (Flew Rouge from Toronto to Las Vegas and on these flights you have to pay for food). Flight crew: Young, but very helpful especially with the baby and the car seat. Checked twice to see that the seat was approved (which is important to everyone). Service was decent. Communication: Our outbound flight was delayed 3 hours due to someone deploying an emergency chute while the plane was on the ground. Communication wasn't great but I did find out the reason by speaking nicely to a person on the desk. Announcements were made twice that we had a $10 credit to spend in the terminal on food. Not a lot, but at least we only had to show our boarding pass to get the credit, so did not have to line up for a voucher. Inflight entertainment: Runs on iPad (your own or one you can rent for $10) or some Android devices. Had no problems with Android on this trip (did have on a previous trip, so they may have fixed this). One plane had universal plug/usb outlets for charging, but one did not, so I wouldn't count on this. A reasonable selection of movies for a 7 hour flight. We all arrived safely, our luggage arrived as well, there was enough on board storage for carry on luggage now that Air Canada is enforcing the size restrictions on carry on luggage (something I approve of) and it all was relatively uneventful. Overall I would fly Rouge again but only in a Rouge Plus seat. It is convenient not to have to transfer in say Frankfurt to get to less travelled destinations in Europe like Lisbon. I like the non stop flights that are offered by Rouge. You need to understand however that this is not the top tier product and you are paying for a lesser product but not having to stop anywhere.\",\n",

The negatives - I ordered a special (DBML) meal on the return flight but did not get it. Also Air India's online check-in has a glitch - I've faced this problem five times in the past (out of five attempts). The problem - at the end of the online check-in screens after entering passport and visa details, the system flashes an error message. At the airport staff struggle to rectify the error and have to consult manuals/supervisors etc. On the last occasion I tied up one check in counter for 20 minutes while they tried rectifying this problem.\",\n",

My guess that this enabled the service of a snack and a light meal on the 6 and 10 hours sectors. Personally i'd rather have dinner at 7 on the short sector. Breakfast much later on the long sector to try to get a sleep. Serving a snack later would be enough.\",\n",

There's a mattress and pillow behind your seat and you are bombarded with free gifts from Bvlgari, pyjamas, slippers, writing kit etc. The cabin manager will greet you and explain how to operate all the toys in your cabin and as the cabin wasn't full we virtually had our own hostess who appeared from nowhere every time you opened you doors. The food is excellent and served to order with plenty of well aged spirits, Dom Perignon, wines and soft drinks. This cabin doesn't have toilet cubicles it has bathrooms with a shower! There's also a self service bar near the bathrooms or you can use the bar at the rear of Business class.

Nice seat pitch gave me some extra leg room (I am 6'4'') from what I am used to, service was fine. I was very impressed with the safety briefing we got (we have an infant). I actually learned something about the brace position while carrying an infant. Not mentioned by any of the airlines I have traveled with previously. Cabin pressure and cleanliness was excellent. The flight seemed to be over in no time, I got off the plane in a good mood. All in all a pleasant experience.\",\n",
       " 'Me and my wife flew from Mumbai on 6th July to New York via Doha. Both ground as well as flight staff were very courteous. All meals served onboard were of a high quality and wholesome. Looking forward to our return journey on 22nd August from New York JFK.',\n",
       " \"Traveled with spouse, daughter-in-law, and 18 month old grandchild. Purchased tickets for the adults in February, paying extra for early boarding. Daughter-in-law decided she wanted to purchase a ticket for her child and have her sit in an airline approved car seat on plane, instead of on her lap. Agent told her not to bother paying the early boarding fee when she purchased her child's ticket as the child would be boarding with her mother. My daughter-in-law traveled this way with her child several times on Southwest without a problem. However, at Fort Lauderdale, when she attempted to board the aircraft with her child, the agent told her that even though her ticket listed her boarding group as A23, her baby's ticket said boarding group C and she would have to wait for that group to be called! During the heated discussion that followed, several passengers behind us boarded the aircraft. Finally she was permitted on the aircraft. My husband went to sit in the seat across the aisle from us and was told that seat was taken. Another passenger claimed he was saving several seats (I believe it was 6) for his family. The flight attendant was standing just one row away and was aware of this behavior. My husband ended up sitting behind us. A woman who sat in the window seat near him plopped her bags on the seat and said to leave them there as she did not want to have anyone sit in the middle seat. It appears to me that Southwest needs to revise its seating procedure! If you have paid an extra fee for priority boarding you are entitled to board according to the status printed on your ticket. If your family members( who are not young children) have not paid for priority boarding, you should not be able to block passengers from claiming a seat for which they have paid an extra priority boarding fee. If you are unhappy if someone wants to claim a middle seat, too bad! You should be forced to sit there instead. The same goes for all the baggage folks drag on the plane. Half of the passengers look like they are fleeing a war ravaged land carrying on huge bags or multiple bags. If the airline would support their seating and baggage policies all passengers would be much less aggravated.\",\n",
       " 'Having to book a last second business trip from DFW to ATL, I had few options. AA was $649 (not including $50 for a checked bag round trip) round trip, Delta was $726 (not including $50 for a checked bag round trip) round trip and Spirit was $276. Now, most of the review I have read on this site, are people complaining about all the charges for bags. I read everything on the website, including the baggage fees, and paid for my carry on and 1 checked bag at the time I booked my flight. The total flight cost, including my baggage fee, came out to $390. If you are complaining about the baggage charges, learn how to read! The plane got me to ATL on time, and back to DFW on time. What I did not like was the seat did not recline, and the overall attitude of the flight crew. But, I saved $309. ',\n",

       " 'Check-in at Boston went smoothly and the plane boarded on time. I enjoyed using the free personal device entertainment United offers on their Airbus aircraft. While waiting at Newark Liberty for my next flight to Chicago, I was notified two hours before take off that my plane would be delayed and I would miss my final flight to Appleton. I was quickly placed on stand-by for another flight to Chicago, but soon realized I would not be able to get on that flight, as others were trying to fly stand-by as well. I had to take my original flight, which was delayed three hours, due to the fact that the aircraft was coming from Dallas and was delayed due to storms. I missed my original flight to Appleton, so was booked on a later one. In all, I spent about 15 hours on planes and in airports. It was a long day, but except for one customer service representative at Newark, who acted as if I was an inconvenience, every other United employee I dealt with was kind and helpful. ',\n",
       " \"I recently flew to Mykonos through Athens and must say it was a very pleasant experience. The Zurich - Athens - Zurich legs were in Business class, to which I was upgraded for free being a Gold Member of their program Miles and Bonus. During the inbound flight I was served a 4 course menu, with 2 choices for the main course, with excellent wines, return flight was in the morning, so breakfast with 2 choices of eggs (scrambled and omelette), fresh fruit platter, greek yoghourt and bread. Responsible for the Business class section was every time the Maitre de cabine, who was very attentive and kind. Flights were on time (ish) and transfer in Athens was easy and smooth, even though inbound luggage could not be through-checked because of the lack of customs in Mykonos Airport (it was on return though). Only slight downside was check-in at Mykonos at 6 am, with only 2 counters open and queue moving very slowly, taking me 20 minutes to check-in my suitcase. But I guess that's more a matter of the airport than the airline.\",\n",

In Rome we found out that our flight to Tokyo was cancelled - crew on the airport wasn't very helpful, but the call centre proved to be the best solution to sort us out and we had our tickets rebooked for direct flight with Alitalia to Tokyo Narita. So the 1st leg we didn't fly with Aeroflot (if not for the call centre we would be probably stranded in Rome). The return flight on A330-300 was better than we expected - 3 or 4 yrs old aircraft with a decent amount of leg space (in comparison with Alitalia it was better), pretty good IFE and really nice food - sushi and seafood pasta which I can say was probably the best onboard meals I've ever had. SVO-FCO in A320 was also nice, good Recaro blue seats and again pretty good meals. Service wasn't smiling a lot, but was attentive and my and my group really enjoyed the flights. All in all Aeroflot exceeded expectations! would definitely recommend it (except for the airport staff in Rome which wasn't helpful at all with rebooking the ticket!).\",\n",

LCY can get quite busy in the mornings but managed to find a seat without any problems. Bused to the aircraft. Onboard great friendly service, complimentary drink and duty free items offered. Flight time approx. 1 hour. Return: Check in at GCI can be a bit slow espicially if there are a couple of other flights departing around the same time. Same friendly service on board for the return trip. The aircraft used is the smaller version of the ATRs they have in their fleet but offers the same cabin layout as the bigger ATR aircraft, the seat pitch is exactly the same. This is Aurigny's newest route and is a great alternative to Gatwick and would highly recommend this for anyone starting or finishing their journey in central London. If you book in advance the fares are reasonable and once you factor the train cost to Gatwick the fare is not much different. LCY is a great airport to travel through, quick, easy and hassle free compared to the bigger London airports.\",\n",

This flight was excellent as it was only half full and I had a whole row of 4 seats to myself. The seats in economy are arranged 3-4-3 and quite comfortable, there was no one behind so I could recline my seat. ICE entertainment was very good but not the latest version as on the A380. The food was OK and they were generous with the drinks making several runs with the trollies during the flight and picking up litter. Unfortunately this is not always the case with Emirates, I've been on full flights with bad crew who are stingy with the drinks, slow with the food then leave your tray for 2 hours so you can't leave your seat, all deliberate tactics because they can't be bothered to deal with a full flight, over 300 people.\",\n",

They share a lounge with other airlines but it was ok with nice views over the runway. The flight was good with good service from the attentive staff who knew our names and occasionally stopped to chat. The food choices were good, good Moet champagne and a lot of drinks options with good aged spirits. The seats are is 2-3-2 and we always try to prebook 2 together by the window. ICE entertainment system is excellent, probably the best in the air, and very good noise cancelling headphones. The seat is comfortable with a perfect preset recline position but you can adjust it how you want or lie-flat. They provide a mattress if you want to sleep. DXB-BKK on the A380. The Business cabin is nearly all the top deck apart from 3 rows of First in the front. The seat arrangement is staggered so if you want to sit together your only choice is in the middle so you won't get a window seat. However these seats are surrounded by furniture so you're away from the aisle so very cosy. The service was excellent and the staff seemed happy to serve. The seat is different but just as comfortable and of course lie-flat. It has the same ICE system. However the beauty of the A380 is the bar or inflight lounge with it's long, comfy seats and plenty of standing area. Both flights were on time and you get a fast pass to avoid the long queues at passports in BKK and your bags have priority so will be out before you. And Emirates provide a free chauffeur service into Bangkok, we had a nice Mercedes.\",\n",

Being able to fly directly into regional airports missing out Heathrow is a big plus. Seat comfort not great, then no economy seat is comfortable for 11 hours! I did find the seats very hard and I needed to sit on a pillow. The flight was extremely full - every seat taken, good for the airline but not good for passengers! Food a mixed bag, good dinner on way back but no breakfast served before arrival in Perth instead a chicken dinner meal? Would have preferred a cold breakfast - fruit or just a bread roll option. A potato sandwich was served as a snack before landing in Manchester. The pasta dish was good and the noodle dish was excellent. Ground staff did take a bottle of suntan lotion bought in duty free at Manchester fully sealed in a tamper proof bag with receipt showing, despite being assured by the shop assistant in Manchester that it would not be a problem transiting with it so long as it was in the tamper proof bag. Etihad please communicate with other airports re this if this is your policy! Another point on transiting, I fully understand the need for enhanced security at the gate however once you are in the gate you cannot go out and there is no water available or toilet facilities in the gate. Also better crowd control was needed at Manchester as when announced that rows 1 to 3 could board - literally more than half the passengers stood up and started to queue, despite being told several times not to!',\n",

We were assured that Thai staff would reconnect our flights at Bangkok so that we wouldn't need to do anything. When we finally left NZ (8 hours later) and reached Bangkok we were provided with a hotel room and free breakfast. That was refreshing and much appreciated. However, Thai Airways arranged for our flights direct to Amsterdam via another airline but unfortunately didn't tell us. So we were running around Bangkok Airport trying to figure out where our new boarding passes were, who was flying with whom and when. We also didn't know what happened to our luggage. Finally, it took 46 hours in total to reach Amsterdam (includes delay, overnight stay, flights in transit) from Auckland. Better communication to stranded passengers would have resulted in an ideal outcome as we were unsure as to how long we would be stranded in Bangkok and the location of our luggage. In saying that, the Thai Airways staff on the plane were friendly, food was fantastic, and the ample refreshments were great. We enjoyed the flight service better than the ground service.\",\n",

Had issues with passenger behind us that allowed their child to continuously kick the back of our seat. We asked the mother once of the problem yet the child continued. Asked again to please have your child stop the kicking. Third time was enough and flight crew intervened and helped settle the problem. A cookie for the kicking child and a glass of wine for us. Very odd situation but handled OK by crew. Overall the flight seemed short handed, stressed and just did not want to do their job. Return flight back was like night and day. Our baggage was well above the limit but nothing was said and they checked us in with no questions. Both flights were on time. Ground staff friendly and helpful, cabin crew were friendly, helpful and outgoing. Meals were actually tasty and there were non-stop beverage runs. The crew came across happy and willing to please the passengers. I got on the plane dreading the flight but departed with a positive attitude. Seating is tight though.

My son and I sat in the back row of 4 seats in the front section, the flight wasn't full so we had all 4 seats to ourselves, a bonus. However the seats are wider with more leg room than on 777. The ICE entertainment system is excellent with over 100 movies for a 7 hour flight and the screen is big. The headphones are ok but I recommend taking your own to block out all noise. The service was excellent, maybe because it wasn't a full flight, and the food was good and they were quick with the drinks and made several drinks run throughout the flight. The next leg to Delhi was a 777 so I prebooked the 2 seats together at the back of the plane but when we went to the gate to board we were upgraded to business class, probably because the flight was full or overbooked but another welcome bonus. The business cabin is spacious with seat arrangement 2-3-2, we were in 2 of the middle 3.

The seat was however lie flat and was quite comfortable although storage space for small items is lacking. The service onboard was excellent. The cabin crew were attentive and helpful.

I have had issues with the seat belts being tight on other airlines and this is the first time I have had plenty of extra slack with the seat belt. I also found the seats to be a little wider than what I have experienced in the past. I did purchase a couple of snack items from their menu and they were very good. They offer a wide selection of items to eat for many different tastes. The attendants were all excellent, going out of their way to help and bring pillows, blankets, headphones, etc. I noticed one lady was offered an iPad to watch when her screen wasn't working and another passenger was moved to an empty seat to be more comfortable. I myself was offered a seat up in SAGA class when I mentioned I wasn't feeling well. I did not take them up on it but I appreciated the offer being made.

After 10 years of flying PIA\\'s Business Class, you get used to the CIP lounge in Islamabad, which, although renovated and refurbished, still lacks a lot when compared to Emirates, Qatar Airways or Etihad. After the long wait, the boarding started slightly behind schedule. Since Islamabad Airport doesn\\'t have jetways, we boarded via stairs, and as we entered the aircraft, I immediately realised that the AC\\'s weren\\'t on. We had to sit in this inferno for about 20-30 minutes before the engines were started. Post-takeoff, menus were distributed and the food trolley was rolled out. The food was delicious, and I even opted for seconds. After lunch, I realised that the IFE wasn\\'t working, and when I flagged down a stewardess to ask why the IFE had failed, her response was \"technical failure\" and was not very helpful. The rest of the flight was uneventful. Business Plus passengers were allowed to de-board first.

The flights were all smooth. Crews on Jakarta - Sydney sector VV were senior but they were very nice and courteous. My family and I flew QF 41 and 42 last year and we felt the same aircraft was used (A330). What we disliked most was the TV monitor which looks decent and small and AVOD selection (no asian songs). I guess we do not get any amenities like used to. Toilets only provide liquid soap. As for food and beverages, I can not complain. On Sydney - Christchurch sector VV, there were only three cabin crews serving more than one hundred passengers. The crews looked young. They tried their best to serve, 10 minutes before landing ice cream was still being distributed. Customer Service Manager informed me that they were short of crews and apologized if they could not give me water. On Sydney - Jakarta leg, all cabin crews worked extremely hard to please us.',\n",
       " 'At Melbourne used the Business Lounge. Pre-departure drinks after boarding, and after departure a refreshment was served of turkey sandwich, rice salad with salmon and soup.  Our aircraft had IFE and BSI, which made the experience even better.',\n",
       " \"This was my return leg to Brussels via Doha on Qatar business class. The first leg was on their 777-300 which after flying out on the 787 and A380 could not be as good, how wrong. The cabin is very spacious and like First class on other airlines. The seat arrangement is 2-2-2 with massive seats, about a metre of leg room/standing space and wide aisles. The seats are much more comfortable, especially in lie-flat than the new seats on the 787, A380 proving that older can be better. The service was excellent and all the staff new our names. There's a free Armani gift for male and female which are placed on the right seats before boarding, a nice touch. The food and drink options are not too impressive but I was quick to order as they ran out of some choices on our outbound flights. The second leg was on the new 787 Dreamliner. The seat arrangement is 1-2-1 but there's not as much room as on the 777 and not as comfortable as I discovered when I tried to sleep, this was an overnight leg. They provide a very thin mattress, a very comfy pillow and a nice blanket if you want to sleep, plus eye cover and earplugs are in your Armani gift set. I skipped the main meal as I'd just eaten in the lounge but I had the breakfast which was nice, with real cappuccino and fresh orange juice. All 4 legs (including my outbound) were on time with good service, overall a good first impression of Qatar after flying several times on Emirates.\",\n",
       " 'Departed BKK on time at 02:40. In flight service was immaculate, superb dinner and wines (3 white and 3 red) served as and when requested, pajamas handed out and flat bed seats as comfortable as any in the air. Doha is a joy for transit passengers who do not have to bother with yet another security check. Lounge is huge with extensive facilities. The second flight was my first on a 787 and I was surprised - I found the experience less enjoyable that the 777. The herring-bone flat bed seat 1-2-1 layout seemed more cramped and I found no advantage in all the hyped up Dreamliner benefits. Still I slept much of the way. Arrived on time! For price, comfort, connections and the joy of not having to cope with Heathrow, Qatar Airways is almost impossible to beat',\n",
       " \"I recently flew to Bangkok from Brussels via Doha with Qatar in Business class. The main reason was price as they had a genuine buy one get one free companion sale and it was only 짙925 each when it was over 짙1800 from London. Check in was good but they share the British Airways Lounge, I've seen a lot of 1 out of 10's for British Airways on this site so enough said. The first leg was on the Qatar Airways 787 Dreamliner, the seat arrangement is 1-2-1 with only 5 rows so quite exclusive. The seats are cocoon, lie-flat bed style, fully remote controlled, with a big TV, desk, pull-out table, pillow etc and a nice welcome pack of eye cover, ear plugs, lip balm and some nice Armani products. The staff are excellent as to be expected from Qatar Airways but the menu and drinks options were not too impressive. However my wife enjoyed the pink champagne and I enjoyed their signature lime and mint juice pre-flight drinks. The inflight drinks options were limited unless you like wine, lots of wine choice. They don't carry enough of each meal so my wife and I did not get our first choice as we were sat in the back row of 5 they'd ran out! The second leg was on their brand new A380 with business class on the top deck. The seats and arrangement is the same as the 787 just more rows. The icing on the cake and by far the best selling point is the bar. The hostess on bar duty was lovely and made everyone welcome. There was a good choice of drinks and bar snacks, especially the individual carrot cakes. You get a fast pass before landing to avoid the hour long queue at passport control but no free chauffeur service, come on Qatar. Your bags get priority so they're on the carousel before you get there. Overall a good first impression although I was on their newest aircraft, can't wait to fly the new A350.\",\n",
       " \"Our flight from Singapore to Kuala Lumpar was great. The flight is only 45mins but had a drink service, and WiFi - I didn't expect them to have this option. You can also listen to music, read about the airline and watch a small variety of movies. This seats were comfortable. The only disappointment was there was no snack with the drinks.\",\n",
       " 'Nice new A321 aircraft, friendly crew, flight on time - short 1 hour 20 minute flight. The aircraft had overhead screens but they were only really used for the safety video (which curiously they only do in English and then ask passengers who speak one of their three main languages to ask the crew if they have questions). Strange croissant with a pretzel coating (but in my past experience Swiss food is not nice, even in business) and wide selection of drinks including alcohol. I had flown out on Austrian and the quality of Swiss is just a couple of notches higher. I did check in online but the Swiss website sends you to Lufthansa for some reason. Automatic check-in is a nice touch but their app remains awful as you have to re-login each time you switch app to access your boarding pass.',\n",
       " \"CX714 from Singapore to Hong Kong and CX635 return. My first experience with Cathay Pacific was brilliant. The check in agent guided me on the self check in procedures and helped me in registering for the marco polo club (Cathay's frequent flyer program). Despite a 55 minute delay, boarding commenced quickly. Warm smiles greeted you as you enter the aircraft. One of the crew guided me to my seat. The seat itself has generous legroom and is very comfortable with a nose wheel camera view in the InFlight Entertainment. Despite being served a cold sandwich and some drinks during the flight, the inflight service was excellent as the crew efficiently distributed the cold sandwiches, as well as offering a few drinks. The flight came to an end with a sunrise and a touchdown in Hong Kong.\",\n",
       " 'LHR to ADD, June 8, return 30th. Excellent flight both ways. Superb planes. Helpful cabin staff. Smooth boarding at new LHR Term 2 compared to old T3. Flight time now only 7 hours. By far the best way to get to Addis. Addis airport efficient both ways. Do not like arriving at new LHR T2, massive long walks, baggage slow, not enough lifts from arrivals to public transportation. Aspects of the design of this new terminal at Heathrow are very poor. ',\n",
       " 'AUH-MNL, exemplary except the food, which is always a bit disappointing. Lovely flat bed seats, attentive and friendly service, great drinks selection and good IFE. Hard to fault, though they let themselves down on the food.',\n",
       " \"The ground crew were polite, professional, and cared about trying to make us happy. We had a baby, so we had to go to the transfers desk to print our boarding passes. They helped us bypass long lines so that we could make our connection on time. Because we were boarding from a connecting flight we weren't able to arrive early enough to claim the bassinet seating (there were lots of babies on the plane) but the flight hostess was able to find another seat for the woman sitting beside my wife, so we had a place to put out 6 month old instead of holding him the whole time. The plane was clean and comfortable, and the food was acceptably good for airplane food. The hostesses were very friendly, professional and presentable. I would recommend this airline.\",\n",
       " 'Smooth flight on upper deck of the Boeing 747-8. Seat is very comfortable. Food was excellent, crew upbeat and professional.  Pilot updated us on flight details frequently and a smooth landing. No idea why many critics here demand that the flight attendants smile for 12 hours, I always prefer friendly staff who I trust would act professional in an emergency case instead of a constant smile and no clue what to do if it counts.',\n",
       " \"Travelled from Manchester to Faro on the 30th June and returned on 5th July. Check in went smoothly-clerk was pleasant and efficient. Slight delay on the outbound due to a nervous passenger being offloaded. Once under way the cabin crew offered a high standard of service. Flight crew kept us informed and kept passengers up to date. Did not buy any food etc so can't comment on this section. No inflight entertainment but not a problem for 2.5 hour flight. Seats were the older type so were comfortable. Return flight left Faro late due to amount of flights but we landed 20 mins late. Cabin crew very nice. Short wait for luggage on return at Manchester.\",\n",
       " 'Effective check-in and transferring. Cabin crew attentive and friendly. Very limited legroom, making the flight really uncomfortable when the flight is full as was the case on the BCN-DOH leg. I am a regular flyer and have found the legroom on all four flights to be exceptionally limited compared to other airlines. Serving of meals on the first two legs seemed disorganized. I was served my meal only two hours after the meal service started. On the second leg I received my meal relatively quickly, but the passengers sitting five rows ahead of me were only served about an hour later. I could not figure out the logic. Serving of meals on the return flights were well organized though.',\n",
       " \"We flew with Small Planet Airlines to Zante in June. On arrival at airport we checked in quickly and flight was on time. Staff very good and friendly, boiled sweets were offered on landing. Flight home delayed half hour but didn't matter. A pleasant flight, captain kept us informed throughout journey. Definitely would use again.\",\n",
       " 'First long haul flight on Thomas Cook. Good seat with good legroom, nice food, very good price. Departure both ways on time.',\n",
       " \"I spontaneously bought bargain tickets on Allegiant, then read numerous negative reviews. After reading those, I was very uneasy about flying Allegiant to Florida, especially with two young children. Our non-stop round trip from Columbus to Fort Lauderdale was one of the easiest experiences that I've had with an airline. The price was half of the competition, all flights were on schedule, the planes were clean, and staff were courteous. The plane's seats were not plush, but were more than adequate in size. We will be flying with Allegiant again!\",\n",
       " 'Short flight on an A320 with friendly cabin crew and a good selection of drinks available. They used to serve a sandwich on European flights, nowadays one gets a small pack of Pretzels. No IFE and not so comfortable seats. If you are taller than 1.80 m it might be a bit too narrow.',\n",
       " \"I was pleased to see that British Airways now uses 'proper' gates at Terminal 3 Heathrow, compared to the previous bus boarding scrum. The boarding was organised, the crew friendly and the onboard service good. We were served a tasty ham and cheese croissant with drinks, the flight departed and arrived on time and bags arrived quickly. The seat wasn't very comfortable but all in all, very good!\",\n",
       " 'Overall a great airline. The check-in process is my only complaint after may years of flying with them. I carry an instrument with me when I fly that is oversized. It fits in the overhead bins and does not take up more room in the end than your average suitcase but the dimensions are odd. The last time I flew the check-in staff said there was absolutely no way I could bring it on board. We argued back and forth, got managers involved, threatened to change our flights. Eventually we got approval. A previous time I flew Cathay I booked my ticket at the last minute due to a medical emergency with my wife. I had a 50 minute layover in Tokyo, but that was the best I could do. I went to the airport the night before to try and be put on standby on a flight that evening so I would certainly make my connection. I have never been treated so poorly. Nobody would listen to what was going on. Everyone just said no and walked away. Turns out the flight was not even full, they were just not willing to help. The flights are wonderful however. The planes are well-maintained and seats are comfortable. Staff are quite attentive and friendly. The food was decent for airplane food. In-flight entertainment was as good as any I have experienced. In the end I highly recommend Cathay Pacific but they need to work on their ground staff as they were rude and inattentive.',\n",
       " 'Hong Kong to Zurich and return from Heathrow to Hong Kong, booked in Premium Economy but very fortunate to receive an upgrade on the HKG-ZRH leg. The fish dinner in business out of Hong Kong was so fresh and simply superb, as was the service. Unfortunately we ran through a lot of clear air turbulence during the night but we need to be reminded that this is not the fault of the airline that such meteorological phenomenon occur. The return flight in PE out of Heathrow was jammed packed but the cabin crew did their best, despite annoying fellow travellers who think it fun to recline their seats during the take off roll. On this flight, I thought again that its time passengers were allowed to tip cabin crew for good service. One again wonders why this is not allowed? It may just make a huge difference to our travel experiences, on some airlines. I recommend the HKG-ZRH run on Cathay for a good convenient service into Europe.',\n",
       " \"It's not the first time I flew on CX889 YVR-HKG (originating from JFK). It was no different. We were informed that the flight was delayed 2 hours in which originally would not allow me to connect to my connecting flight CX705 to Bangkok. Upon check in, the handling was great and they moved my Bangkok flight to CX713 which leaves 40 minutes later. We were also given a 10$ coupon for food as a result of the delay. We left Vancouver at 4.05am local time (originally should be at 2.00am) and we hit some turbulence near the Hokkaido region of Japan and again off-coast Japan to the south. We arrived at 8.15am+1 (should be 7.40am+1 after delay or 5.40am+1 originally). A ground staff was waiting for me and assisted me to my connecting CX713 flight. I was the last person on board but did make it safely through the crowd. We arrived Bangkok early just to find out that my luggage wasn't successfully transferred from the Vancouver flight and that it would arrive around 2.00pm on CX653. Therefore, I contacted the Thai Airways office to deliver my luggage to my house and it arrived at 8.45pm. In-flight service was excellent on both flights, even though we had unexpected issues come up.\",\n",
       " 'Flight was half-full. I had the whole row to myself. The flight took of on time and one hour later the service started. I could choose 2 drinks. The meals service had two choices: 1) meat ball with couscous, salad and chocolate cake. 2) tuna salad, some fruits and a honey cake. After the meal service the lights inside the cabin were turned off. Every hour one of the cabin crew members came around with water. During the whole flight there was juice available in the rear galley. Two hours before landing the cabin crew gave us a second meal. Omelette, bun, butter, salad and lemon cake (that was very good). We landed on time.',\n",
       " \"Check-in took over an hour at BOM, despite the best efforts of the ground staff. Boarding was done in sequence and the ground staff ensured passengers didn't get away. Smooth flight, excellent cabin crew, comfortable seating, decent food, and loads of entertainment. Luggage at DXB took over 45 mins to arrive. All in all would still recommend Emirates for the flight journey.\",\n",
       " \"It was a great relief to finally have an excellent crew on this leg. My last 2 flights to BKK return left me so frustrated and very disappointed with Emirates. It's a shame for the airline because when you get an excellent crew, Emirates is a fantastic airline to fly with. Yesterday's crew provided lots of attention towards their passengers. My daughter was in economy on the same flight and agreed on the great service too. Interesting find was that when you book an Emirates flight on Qantas website, the chauffeur service is no longer approved even though it says you're eligible to it! Just be aware.\",\n",
       " \"CAI-DXB, first leg of CAI-MEL with Qantas but this leg operated by Emirates. Check-in at CAI crowded but done professionally. On-time departure. Captain very good at communicating flight status and arrival information. Aircraft was quite new and well kept. Children's meals arrived before others and with suitable choices. Our meals ok but nothing special. Movie selection was a little disappointing compared to previous Emirates flights. I struggled to find something decent to watch. Unfortunately at DXB aircraft was parked ages away from the terminal, which meant a 20 min bus ride. Overall, a pretty good experience but still issues with making the Qantas-Emirates interaction feel seamless, especially at check-in and transit.\",\n",
       " \"Flew EY653 AUH-CAI and return EY654 CAI-AUH. Check in at Etihad Air Mall in DXB was smooth and took the coach to AUH. First flight was smooth drinks were passing around all the time, though it is Ramadan. Meal was not good at all,  it was a morning flight they served lunch. With small portions and not up to standards of other competition on the same sector. Crew were friendly though seemed new or a bit lost. Seats are comfortable on the A340. Headsets are top notch but not their entertainment system - not user friendly one and less options. And it doesn't work until half way of the flight and crew collect head sets almost an hour before landing. On the return flight it was almost empty. With a very cold cabin surprisingly there were no blankets on the flight to be offered . No drink rounds. Meal was just a Ramadan Iftar box with some bland sandwiches for a 4 hrs flight. No tea or coffee offered and crew just disappeared. They were very keen on selling their duty free products only. My entertainment system had a problem with the audio and informed the crew - she just apologised with no offer to transfer to another seat with the flight almost empty and many rows were totally deserted and I had to use the entertainment system on the seat next to me which was free as well. Still the seats were comfortable. Would use EY again only if the fares are very competitive. Transfer to DXB with their shuttle bus smooth both ways. However AUH airport is crowded and a bit confusing. \",\n",
       " 'Outside of aircraft dirty but inside new and clean. Cabin crew young and enthusiastic. Full meal despite short (2 hr) flight. IFE acceptable. ',\n",
       " 'The check-in process was fast and easy. I travel with an instrument and rather than making a fuss about it, they tagged it so I would get by even more easily. The food and beverage service was superior to any airline I have flown. The cabin crew were friendly and staff quickly responded to any request made. The layover in Seoul was easy and everything left on time.',\n",
       " \"This was our first time flying Lufthansa. While the organization that paid for my flight booked an economy ticket, I noticed the opportunity to bid on premium economy tickets for 3 of the 4 legs of our round-trip flights. Our bids were accepted for two of the flights, but not accepted for the third. Ironically, this is the one leg for which we had bid the most because we hadn't been able to secure good seats in the economy class. Even more ironic, when we checked in for this specific leg, we asked if there was an opportunity to upgrade class and we were able to do so at half the cost of what we had bid. Overall, the experience in premium economy was good. Much more room than the typical economy seat. But one leg was a bad experience. On the final leg, the seat map that we used to choose our seats was not accurate. It showed our two seats being in front of a set of bathrooms. When we boarded the plane, we found that our row was actually the first row after the bathrooms. Because we were on the side row, there was no wall or curtain between us and the bathroom. It essentially became a seven-hour flight sitting next to the bathroom. We would have been much better off with our original economy seats. I'm surprised that Lufthansa would not have designed this section better and that they didn't have a more accurate seat map.\",\n",
       " 'Excellent airline! Seats very comfortable, flight attendants smiling.

They provided a very tasty sandwich with a large variety of drinks. They do not charge for the luggage! ',\n",
       " 'Initially booked flight in economy at a great price and was invited to bid for an upgrade to business which I did and was accepted (overall price bid for this seat was exceptional). Given priority at Sydney airport check-in/immigration and access to the business lounge which was a lovely touch. Business class seats were roomy and very comfortable. Staff were pleasant, nothing was any trouble and food was really tasty (Nasi Lemak and gorgeous Malaysian chicken/beef skewers later in the trip before landing). If MAS can maintain this standard, they are on a winner. A very enjoyable flight.',\n",

Their Premium Economy surpasses any other Premium Economy class that I have flown on other airlines. Most charge almost double for the same service. I hope Norwegian eventually figures out that if they added lie-down flat business class seats they would be even more competitive. I used Norwegian on a return flight from JFK-LGW and and back.

       " \"Just returned from a 2 week graduation trip to Europe with 33 of my fellow students and 5 teachers. Outbound we were scheduled to take off around 8:00 PM on a flight from Oakland to Stockholm, but the plane, a Boeing 787, encountered a bird strike as it arrived into Oakland that left the right wing damaged. Crews at Oakland originally believed the damage was easily fixable and we would depart later that night however, the damage ended up being worse than expected, and the plane was deemed unable to fly. Norwegian specially arranged another aircraft operated by HiFly to fly us to Sweden two days later. As it was 3 AM, and knowing that we lived over 2 hours away, Norwegian paid for a hotel for all 39 of us, as well as the transportation to get there and the bus home the following day. Not only that, but the airline paid for a charter bus to get us back to the airport on Friday, and is going to refund each traveler 600 euros. As far as the flights go, the crews on both the flight to Stockholm and the return flight were great. The ride back to America on the B787 was the most comfortable I've experienced - plenty of room, and the in-flight entertainment was top notch. Overall, excellent customer service to go along with affordable prices.\",\n",
       " 'Outbound flight 18 December 2014 from JFK to London Gatwick. Return Flight 5 March 2015, LGW to JFK. Overall this was my best transatlantic flight. Due part to the new Boing 787 and also to the services Norwegian offers. I was a bit apprehensive because of some of the negative reviews on this site. Flights were on time, staff was very good. Flight attendants were American and very good. Pilots were British and that is always reassuring. A few minor negatives such as: Lounge at JFK not good (Korean Air) and some of the ground staff at London Gatwick not good. Overall a superb experience and very good value for money. Also the fact that flights can be rescheduled in Premium Economy is another plus. Hopefully this airline figures out that adding lie flat seats would make them even more competitive. ',\n",
       " \"DXB-MEL, 12.5 hrs, second leg of CAI-MEL on Qantas ticket but first leg operated by Emirates. Qantas web site wouldn't do online check-in since first leg with Emirates so had to do it on Emirates web site, which wouldn't let me alter DXB-MEL seats. Aircraft new and well kept with comfortable seating. Boarding was fine and departure on-time. Although seats quite close together for such a long flight the leg room was good due to IFE being kept out of the way. Meals were pretty good and staff came around offering snacks and drinks regularly. IFE excellent - I found a good range of films and my kids were kept happy for the whole flight as well. They did most things well, but a few little things let them down: - Not enough immigration forms for all passengers. (Honestly, they know the number of pax on a flight, it can't be that hard) - When I asked for an amenities kit about 1.5 hrs before landing, they told me they had run out. - Flight path maps weren't working so it was hard to tell where we were. (Data like eta, altitude, were working) If they could fix these simple things, it would be a great flight experience for a price below Qatar, Emirates and Etihad.\",\n",

Qantas gets its fair share of criticism but these two flights were absolutely faultless, leaving on time and arriving a few minutes early. The cabin crews were cheerful and provided good service. Inflight meals and snacks were fine (as good as you can expect in these times of cost pressure) and the entertainment system on these newer planes is as good as any. Compliments to Qantas on the product which should get praise.\",\n",

Premium Class also comes with priority check in, priority security line, priority boarding and first off bags at the destination airport. I fly all over the world frequently, and have flown on many airlines and have to say that the flight I took on Thomas Cook today was probably one of the best flights I have taken. From Check in to baggage claim, staff were extremely polite and friendly. The plane was a brand new A330. The seats were very comfortable with good recline. The plane was clean. The entertainment system was easy to use, had a good selection of movies, TV shows and music and it had a USB charging port. I never usually eat the meal when I fly, but I did on this occasion as the food was excellent. The drinks selection was also impressive with lots of premium name brands. ',\n",

We flew Economy (Dublin-Toronto) and it was a great flight. The flight attendants were friendly and smartly dressed. The interior cabin fabric seemed new. The seats weren't too roomy but they didn't feel too small either. The meals were standard fare for my family, decent, although my vegetarian meal (an Indian vegan dish) had to be the best meal I've ever had on any Economy flight, domestic or international. We were pretty much on-time departing and arriving. The in-flight entertainment was a bit laughable, but we had read up on it and knew that going in. It was funny to see such old Hollywood movies available on the Rouge Player (one of the movies was Never Ending Story!). I am a big fan of world movies and some of the world movies were the same as the ones on the Air Canada flight we took to London when we left on our vacation. Our family would definitely try another flight with Rouge again.\",\n",

On the new 10 abreast B777 with the narrow seats, armrests and aisles. My usual aisle seat was most uncomfortable.

The ground crew were very helpful in clarifying my doubts about excess baggage and gave me some time to transfer some items to my backpack.

       " \"Was actually a domestic plus a international flight. Upgraded the domestic ones to Class J (Note: they never mentioned it was business class, and neither did I think it was business class). Domestic: No food, just drinks on board. pretty decent and Class J seats were nice. Staff were tentative and smiling. No complaints at all. International: NRT-SIN-HND (JL711, JL038). Both were good. I ordered the gluten free meal and got exactly what I wanted. Staff were nice, boarding was efficient, and never a minute late. Only thing to say is the IFE, low selection of movies as well as songs (can't blame them as Japan is almost half a decade slow in releasing movies). Food was good. Best parts of JAL: Great Economy seats, and marvellous punctuality. If you are looking to get in for a transfer with only 1.5 hours for transit, this is the airline to take. \",\n",
       " \"The planes are new and well kept. The A380 was a dream with a tomb like silence in the upper deck. The service is as good as any Middle Eastern airline and the connections to places like Vietnam from New York are amazing. The trouble is that they ruin it all with the transfer desk in the Seoul airport. After a relaxing flight, you arrive in Seoul at 5 AM and are tossed into a seemingly endless maze of travellers who are forced to go through security all over again to transfer flights. There are no special lanes for business or first class. Poor families with babies are also tossed into the cauldron. In an otherwise well thought out and spacious airport, it's appalling that they can't get this one part right.\",\n",

While respecting another country?셲 stance on alcohol, I think when one has paid a lot of money for the fare then some respect could be shown for cultural preferences ie wine with dinner. I found the one hour stopover in Dubai very annoying. Passengers must leave the plane, walk a long distance to the transit lounge, then go through security and then get back on the same plane again. bI was sound asleep when we arrived in Dubai and never settled again after this. Flight attendants were excellent but it?셲 a shame they couldn?셳 offer more ie better meals and wine. I flew with Qatar Airways business class 18 months ago and Royal Brunei Airlines does not compare with them,  although I acknowledge that Qatar Airways fares cost more.',\n",
       " \"We flew a one-way flight from London Gatwick to Cork in late May. We'd never been to London Gatwick airport, but it was a fairly pleasant experience. It was odd that the airport did not announce departure gate numbers until an hour beforehand, but it wasn't a big deal. I personally enjoyed doing some shopping and getting a bit to eat before heading to the gate. The boarding was fairly effortless, although Ryanair did not call us by seat number. This resulted in a big bulge of customers at the start of boarding, so we just sat back down and waited. The flight was on-time, We had a pleasant, short flight to Cork. Cork Airport was beautiful and it didn't look like there were many flights arriving that time - our visit through customs was brief and very friendly. It was a pleasant trip and a very inexpensive one too. Our family will definitely fly with Ryanair again!\",\n",
       " \"Is it me or are former first class airlines morphing into 'Low Cost Carriers'? Well it certainly felt like it when travelling 'Plus' class with SAS from Heathrow T2 to Copenhagen T3 on a Thursday afternoon. Although the passenger enjoys certain advantages in 'Plus' this is lost during the actual journey. Crammed together in seats the same as economy, there was no spare middle seat, and the tight pitch revealed itself when the person in front of me reclined his seat. I mean if one is paying extra it should manifest in a more comfortable passage.\",\n",

Overall a very pleasant experience and it's always a pleasure to fly Singapore Airlines.\",\n",
       " \"We checked in at Hong Kong airport quickly and easily. Issued boarding passes and lounge invite. That was the Plaza Premium lounge. A lot of airlines use this lounge so there is a separated area for us airline customers. It is important to ask about that, as the normal part gets quite crowded. The airline reserved area has alcoholic drinks and better quality food. The main area has more substantial food. You can go from one area to the other. Our flight was delayed an hour in Bangkok, so we had plenty time to investigate the lounge. Boarding the flight was done in a hurry to try and make up time. Unfortunately, Hong Kong airport is a busy one, so we had to wait for a new take off slot. In the end, we were about 90 minutes late for take off. These things happen. The flight was smooth and comfortable. SriLankan business class is one of the best in terms of friendly service, good food and drinks. The A/V offering has been boosted in the last year, so now there are over 100 movies. Now nearly all business flights have fully reclining to flat bed seats. On arrival we were issued with priority arrival passes. That saved a few moments as immigration wasn't busy at 10pm. Our bags arrived in minutes and we were out of the airport and in a taxi. By that time the traffic into the city had thinned out, so we made up a bit of time there.\",\n",

Main (warm) Grilled salmon and sea bass fillet, sauteed prawn (leaf spinach / parsley potatoes) - all fish had taste. Crew service friendly, adequate, they listen to what you have to say and always smile. They offer a welcome drink, or 2 if you like. These crew walked around the cabin wishing passengers a nice flight and a nice meal. This crew spoke and understood English better than my previous experiences, a much needed improvement. They understand their product, can tell you about it, for instance: I asked two simple questions: Where the wines were from and where the design of the meals came from. ',\n",

Flight was overbooked, but got into the flight due to my status.',\n",

I flew thrice in the same month on the same route where my overall satisfaction was good.',\n",

By the time I got through security my name was being called for the flight which I almost missed. Due to lateness checking in my suitcase it has gone missing. I suggest seperate check in desks for UK destinations up untill flight departures',\n",

Besides getting the best fare, I only end up paying for what I want. All employees I've had contact with have been pleasant, helpful and courteous. No, you don't get a free bag, a free carry-on, a free soda or any other complimentary items. If you want them you pay for it. I'd always been a fan of Southwest, due to their renegade ways in bringing down the cost of flights, but Allegiant has beaten them at their own game. While I'd be willing to put up with some issue for the sort of savings I get from this carrier, but as of this date, I have no complaints with Allegiant Air.\",\n",

The crew servicing this cabin were the best we experienced on the 4 flights we had.',\n",

Overall a nice flight and I would choose them again if I had the chance.\",\n",

My recent flight had a routing DSM/MSP/JFK/LHR. On arrival at MSP I realized that my connecting flight to JFK was delayed, making the JFK connection impossible. When I explained my dilemma to a very helpful Delta employee in the Delta Club room she immediately worked on getting both me and my luggage onto the MSP/LHR service. An ontime boarding took place and I was greeted with a smile by the cabin services manager. Once airborne dinner was served (a very reasonable meal) promptly allowing the maximum time for sleep. We arrived into LHR on time and I cleared immigration and customs in a little over 30 minutes from touchdown. Delta had done for me exactly what I had asked from them, a safe, pleasant, on time journey. All the staff that I encountered during this trip were friendly and responded positively to my needs. What more could I have asked for?',\n",

Boarded the 737-900 and flight crews standing throughout the plane welcomed passengers with a pleasant greeting. Economy comfort seat was great with the extra legroom, would not have wanted to be in a regular economy seat for the 4 hour flight. Took off on time, good games, movies, TV shows on the large seatback screens. Flight crew stayed busy the whole time serving snacks and drinks with 2 or 3 runs at least. Landed in Atlanta on time in spite of the not so great weather. No complaints, I would recommend!',\n",

Apparently there was a fire at FCO in May so they changed us to CIA but only gave me 2 days notice, which I was annoyed about. Turned out to be a blessing because we flew out of FCO and it was Crazy. I highly recommend CIA. Our flight was on time, no delays. Staff were pleasant. The seats were comfortable. I paid $12 extra for extra leg room so our carry on bags would be guaranteed to fit, as we weren't checking luggage. We both fell asleep promptly and missed any drink service or entertainment. I checked in online, knew all about the fees and charges so as long as you are prepared it shouldn't come as a shock. Either way, zero delays, zero issues, cheap flight.

However the competitive pricing and perfect routing SIN - BUD via HEL then TXL - SIN via HEL made me try them for the first time. I must say, it was quite good. The flights were on time, the A340 planes form SIN - HEL though aging were fairly well kept. Service, though not as slick as QR or SQ, was attentive and more relaxed. No complaints. The seat was comfortable but not a flat bed. IFE adequate and food was good. Excellent lamb dish out of HEL. Of course they don't serve gourmet coffee or tea, but overall, no complaints. The HEL lounge for the international flights side was good with vintage wines and good quality supper food. Very good showers and Helsinki Airport is very easy to navigate. The lounge on the European and domestic side was a little crowded and the snacks spartan. I would fly them again to Europe or even to the Eastern USA if the pricing is competitive.\",\n",

Staff were friendly and polite and the atmosphere was relaxed. I had a very cheap flight (approximately 짙75 return) and to keep the price low, I did not purchase extras such as reserved seats, but my partner and I managed to sit together anyway. I also only took carry on luggage. As well as one bag, you are allowed another small bag to stow under the seat. easyJet are very strict on the one bag policy, Norwegian were more relaxed. As it was a short flight I did not purchase food and drink but took my own. I would definitely fly with this airline again.',\n",

While Rouge does offer in-flight entertainment for free, you need to rent an I-pad to watch movies unless you have your own. I purchased a couple of movies the night before the flight and uploaded them to my SD card for my phone. A lot of people complain about the seats on Rouge, and I somewhat agree with them.  The only thing I would say that Rouge needs to improve is the overall comfort of the seats and they would be a great Low Cost Carrier. On the flight, we had 3 amazing crew. The overall flight was uneventful, and the decent into Abbotsford was amazing! I would fly Rouge again and again just for the reason that its affordable and if you do your homework, you can save yourself some money as well as have the same experience you would have a major carrier.',\n",

However, all the menus were based on egg options during the breakfast. It was below what I expected. Qatar should have provided extensive options to their premium passengers based on the fact that these are passengers who are transitting through Doha and have travelled from all over the world within a 24hrs time zone. On baord service was excellent. You can choose your own time to be served. Compliments to the crew and purser who addressed every single customer by name. The seats lacked privacy and were not comfortable for sleeping. It was very narrow and my knees kept hitting the tray table everytime I tried to move to a different position. The same type of seats are also offered on their B787 and A350 aircarft. It was fine for a day flight, and also for lounging and working, but I would avoid this type of seats for a night flight. I had the best sleeping experience on their B777 aircarft. IFE system was ok. Menu options were limited and the quantity are so small. Onboard lounge served Krug Champagne even for JC passengers. However, things which are lacking on Qatar Airways for their FC and JC passengers are, the free limousine, free wifi on A380, and the extensive menu options both at their Al Mourjan Lounge and on board the aircarft compare to their comppetitor, Emirates. However, I would still choose to fly on Qatar Airways since they are a member of One World Alliance and based on their on board service experienced.',\n",

I only had a very brief visit to their lounge in Doha, but what I saw was very good, my only gripe was that they used buses to and from the planes on both flights in Doha. Qatar Airways London assured that airbridges would be used, especially as they now had a brand new airport, so it looks as if they haven't been informed about them still using buses or they don't want to tell you. As I am 82 years old I find it difficult walking up and down those stairs carrying two cases. Hopefully on my return flight in September, they will use airbridges , I'll have to wait and see. Except for that minor thing, I would have given them 10/10, but I can only give them a 8/10\",\n",
       " \"Was curious to try Qatar, having flown Emirates numerous times between S Africa and Europe. Qatar's pricing is a major draw-card, they were significantly cheaper than Emirates. The trip out of JNB to DOH was great, the plane was not full and a lot of passengers had spare seats around them. Not sure that it would have been as pleasant with a full plane. Having heard so much about the Boeing 787, I was expecting it to be state-of-the-art flying, but I can't say that was the case. The seats are as hard  and very cramped - these seats rate very poorly against the Boeing 777, and the only way I could grab any sleep was by sleeping against the window. The food was really good, and I love the containers they use - much better than any other airline I have flown with recently. Entertainment is great - the range is not quite as extensive as Emirates or BA, but streets ahead of Turkish Airlines. One gripe is that the crew would only serve one drink with dinner, I couldn't have a pre-dinner drink and a glass of wine. Thought that was rather mean. The flight between Doha and Istanbul was also good, despite it being a full flight on a narrow body aircraft. Return flight was great too, my only gripe is that every leg of the journey entailed a bus to get to the terminal building, and another back out. That would be okay if you weren't left in the 38 degree heat. Other than that, I can't fault Qatar.\",\n",

An incredible range of inflight movies including Asian and international films, with fairly large screens. Inflight meal was above average, though not impressive.

I found the seats comfortable although my much taller partner found them to be cramped (as we hadn't opted to pay extra for the extra leg room). Both ground crew and flight attendants were friendly. The most important part though was that the flight departed on time, arrived on time and our checked baggage made it.\",\n",
       " \"DFW-SAN on 25JUN2015, on Spirit Airlines. Flight was on time, aircraft new and clean, and crew was friendly. Keep in mind, flying Spirit, you will pay for everything! I need an aisle seat, I pay $10 per seat assignment at time of booking - $20 well spent. I paid $266 RT (including seat assignments) for DFW-SAN round trip, almost $200 less than any other airline.  I'm not complaining about my $3 coffee and muffin. The A319s still have the older more comfortable, but very cramped seats. I like that Spirit does not have Wi-Fi, or any IFE with a big underseat box that take legroom - they can't afford to give up anymore legroom.\",\n",

       " \"Spirit does what they state on their web site, they get you there - cheaply. For that I give them 5 stars because they did exactly what the said they would do. The plane was full and the seats were close together. I read all about that before I bought the ticket and it was as they said it would be, hence the low cost. Plan ahead and know what to expect and it will be a great experience. Its obvious that some of the people that gave 1 star reviews didn't understand about cost of bags or any extras and not done their homework - and are now very disappointed.\",\n",

       " \"Thomas Cook Airlines really seem to have got their act together. I used to prefer Monarch as a better holiday airline, but they have been deteriorating while Thomas Cook has improved immensely - some of this may be due to the recently refurbished A330s that we flew to the Dominican Republic on. Cabin staff were excellent. Food was pretty good in Economy (inbound), but very good in Premium (outbound). Legroom was very good/excellent in both cabins (and I'm 6ft 3 in). Excellent entertainment (free in premium, 짙4 in economy). To be honest, this was better than some scheduled flights I have been on.\",\n",
       " \"We recently travelled on TOM7654. The aircraft appeared to be new and had funky lighting. Seat pitch on this type of aircraft is adequate and the service offered was proffesional and polite. The snack offerings do seem quite expensive, but the drink prices are on par with other airlines we have flown with who don't offer complimentary drinks. What was disappointing was the behaviour of a group of middle aged women, who thought it was acceptable to shout, scream and chant for the whole journey, the crew did try and reprimand the group several times but to no avail. It just resulted in child like hushing and then more shouting. The group also turned on the crew after landing. I would happily fly this airline again, but if this is the sort of customer Thomson is attracting I think I'd have to look elsewhere.\",\n",
       " 'We flew business class on Tunisair on a business trip to Tunis and had a good flight. A319 on FRA-TUN had business class seats , the crew was always on hand and the lounge in FRA was comfortable and a good choice of food and drinks. During the flight a selection of beverages was available free of charge and the crew offered additional drinks several times. The snack was a little small for the business class price, only a sandwich and a piece of cake was served. The flight back was good also, but there were no business class seats - just economy class seating with free middle seat. The lounge in Tunis is not the most comfortable but it does its job. The crew was friendly. Only minus point here: no food due to problems at Tunis airport (we were informed at the lounge so we had some snacks there). All in all we had two good flights and would use Tunisair again.',\n",
       " \"Flew from BCN-JFK via IST on 7/29/15. BCN-IST was a 3 hour flight on what seemed to be an older A330, but the cabin was in excellent condition. Very comfortable and clean. Entertainment via PTV was great. The meal was satisfying for a 3 hour flight. IST-JFK was on a newer A330 with wifi, and a more modern looking cabin. Each seat with blanket and pillow, comfortable and clean. Entertainment via PTV was excellent, had issues connecting to the wifi, but decided to sleep and didn't bother asking the crew for assistance. Chopard amenity kits were handed out, with lip balm, socks, ear plugs, toothbrush and toothpaste. Two meals served, both of excellent quality. Snack foods also available should you get hungry. DO&CO catering on both flights,  the best economy meals I've had. Extremely friendly, and helpful crew. Excellent cabin comfort, and entertainment.\",\n",

Seats are on a par with pretty much any European low cost carrier or one of the legacy airlines' economy offerings these days. Incredibly quick baggage arrival at A Coruna, though, to be fair we were the only plane in! Prices/quality of food and drink on board seem better than the likes of Ryanair, though just one observation, why on a 80 minute flight, at lunch time do the cabin crew sit and talk amongst themselves at the back for 40 mins, rather than getting the trolley out to feed hungry/thirsty mouths? Overall, Vueling continue to offer a good product, with the advantage of a choice of fares, dependant on whether you want a checked bag, chosen seat etc.\",\n",

I had a 3-3-3 layout on the way home and was glad of the extra space. Flight was fine - slightly un-engaging and sloppy staff (one spilt water over me and didn't even notice). Food was awful though - low quality and very little of it. The Kosher meals served around me though looked huge and tasty! I'd say BA Economy is a better bet overall.\",\n",

The flight to and from BKK with the Boeing 777-300ER. Qatar Airways provides a good service in economy, all flights were on time and the transit at the new Doha airport was painless. They have to work on their inflight entertainment system though, as it is a rather clumsy and unresponsive design. That was really the only issue, for the rest inflight service was good. Some reviewers complain about the limited legroom and uncomfortable seats on the dreamliner but I found both to be adequate. As long as Qatar Airways offer competitive fares they will be on my shortlist for trips to Asia.',\n",

       " \"This was our first AirAsia trip from Perth to Bali. We're spoilt for choice in Perth with multiple flights daily by AirAsia, Garuda, Jetsar and Virgin. We used to fly Jetstar because as a Qantas Club member we could use the QF lounge in Perth - that doesn't open just for Jetstar flights, so you have to jag it when there's a Qantas international flight going out - not that there's many of those these days. So this time we decided to give Air Asia a go because their fares were excellent. Spot on time departure ex Perth, clean aircraft and we paid extra for Row 1. Pleasant enough flight for a LCC. We paid extra for the Red Carpet service on the return journey, and this was an absolute treat. No queues, someone to escort you through immigration, and access to the Premier Lounge which is on a par with the QF Business lounges in Perth. Also you get to board first, so minimal queuing - for frequent travellers to Bali this is worth paying for. The usual customer types on board making it mildly embarrassing for the FA's but they'd be used to it on that run. It was an on time departure, and this time a little IFE with one of the cabin crew playing his guitar and singing over the cabin PA to well deserved applause from the punters. AirAsia is cheap as chips and very efficient - what's not to like on this easy 3.5  hour run between Perth and Bali. \",\n",

       " \"I had high expectations for this return flight to Melbourne based on previous reviews and for the most part Cathay didn't disappoint. I really liked the seat space and privacy. The Boeing 777 version is better than the A330 because the seat storage unit is bigger and the bed position felt wider and softer. I liked it better than BA's business class seat - especially when travelling solo. The catering was a bit hit and miss. The chilli prawns and rice out of London were excellent but a Western style chicken dish from Hong Kong was bland. In general, I think they create better Asian dishes. I've not experienced a business class meal service from a trolley before, and I'm not sure I like it. What I did find odd is that they never provided salt and pepper to season the meal. As a pre dinner drink I enjoyed trying a couple of their signature cocktails (different option on different routes). Boarding was easy, once you found the right line. The lounges in Hong Kong were good but busy. I especially liked the shower facilities and the made-to-order catering. But signage for the lounges was dire, so I struggled to find the one I was looking for at times. The lounges in London and Melbourne are also very small with no views, so I found them quite boring. Of my 4 flights, only 1 actually left on time, which was poor. The choice of inflight entertainment was a bit limited but the screen size was good (although it wasn't possible to tilt the screen for a better viewing angle). The staff were quick to respond to any requests. However, they tended to do things by rote. Once I was asked if I'd like more cashews, but that kind of spontaneity was mostly absent. But they were all very pleasant and welcoming.\",\n",

Seats were very narrow and had a limited pitch. However on account of us having a Bassinet seat got enough leg room for this short haul flight. The service was efficient, they took the drinks trolley thrice and served guests each time. The selection was food. Food was good but seemed very inadequate for a full grown adult like me. Departure and arrival timings were perfect. Inflight ICE System was good and had good selection of shows and movies, though the remote seemed a bit unresponsive at times.

I was lucky and had three seats to myself. Crew didn't take away the spare pillows and blankets so I was left with a comfortable semi bed! Good range of international programming ranging from Chinese to Western to Indonesian on the VOD systems Enjoyable flight with this phoenix of an airline - strange to think it's gone from Indonesia airlines being banned in the EU to a 5 Star rated airline! Sandwiches and crips were available in the galley throughout the flight if you felt peckish - quite a nice touch!\",\n",

I prefer these as they come with noise cancelling headphones and better quality than seat back entertainment. Food was hit and miss but didn't go hungry. Seats are ok for day flight but struggled to get comfortable for the return night flight. I have to agree with other reviews in regards to space between seats. If you are seated against a window or middle seat, you will struggle for space once the people in front of you recline. Also on one leg there was gaffer tape used on one seat.

They also didn?셳 have arrival cards for Japan available during the flight but handed them to us as we disembarked at Narita, which wasn?셳 particularly helpful. When I went to online check-in, it offered the option to pre-order the meal for the SYD-NRT leg, so I opted for the No meal ??I don?셳 want to be disturbed option, as this was an overnight flight leaving at 21.30. A flight attendant duly came up to me to ask me what my ?쐓pecial meal request??was. Something is not working with the pre-order option, as I had a similar thing happen on the return journey. As I got a really good promotional fare, the inconveniences outlined above were bearable, but they're not what I expect of a full-service airline.\",\n",

Champagne was offered in economy - not the most common offering and a welcome change from other airlines who often only offer red/white wine and beer for economy passengers. Comfortable seats with a good range of English, International, Arabic programmes meant the flight was more than tolerable.

FAs very impersonal, but got their job done. Overall, good flights. For the ticket prices, I was satisfied.',\n",
       " \"We had a good flight, great service but the seats in this Boeing 777 were like KLM'S business class, somewhat austere. Our Boeing 777 outbound from YYC had power points and easily accessible USB. Some exec got cheap at KLM and we had to hunting on our hands and knees for the headphone jack which was buried in a strange place and no power points for our electronics. It was quite a sight to see business class passengers on their hands and knees trying to plug their headphones in. We are going to try Air France business class in the future and if that doesn't pan out we are switching back to Lufthansa. I suspect that Cathay Pacific, Korean and Emirates still have a far nicer business class with more perks for the same fare. \",\n",
       " 'TLV to FRA with A321 and then with Lufthansa train to CGN. Check-in was not easy, staff was slow and changed the counter several timers from economy to business to only drop off, so the queues changed and it was a big mix up. Could not upgrade as the plane was full. Flight was almost one hour late before take-off, no information given by ground staff at the gate, even though 5 staff were there. Onboard, crew was nice and service was ok, meal choice was chicken or beef and that was tasty. Arriving in Frankfurt was 15 minutes late,so we had 40 minutes to get to the LH train at the airport-station. Bags did arrive at Air rail-terminal on time, but it was not sure if our oversized luggage would arrive on time. Lost and found was kind to fill up a form, before our LH train leaves. Lost and found did a nice and very good job and they were very good and helpful. So we left for the train, on the platform the train was 5 minutes late, and one of the fine lost and found staff came with our bulk luggage to give it to us. That was a nice touch from the Frankfurt lost and found staff.',\n",
       " 'Short haul very basic, but excellent staff. Transfer in Frankfurt is quite a hassle, long distances to be walked. Crew on long haul flight were okay. Smiling seems an issue, but service is quick. Seating is pretty okay, both legs on refurbished A340-300 which is a really nice long haul aircraft, quiet and spacious. Quality of food more than decent. Drinks assortment not so good. All in all, good flights for a good price.',\n",
       " 'The plane was boarded well in time however the computers had to be rebooted and the flight left 10 minutes late but time was made up anyway. Keeping in mind that Qatar Airways has been voted #1 in the world it is hard to find fault with anything. My only comment would be that over 5 hours is a long way to fly in a narrow body jet. Transiting Doha is now much better with the new terminal. And even better if you have a silver card as you get access to a lounge in Entebbe and Doha. And for most sectors out of Entebbe (Uganda) Qatar offer the best price, which makes them unbeatable really unless you want a direct flight to Western Europe.',\n",
       " 'Our flight times were changed from 6.30am to 9.30am and this was made aware to us by holiday company a week before we flew so not really too much of a problem. Flights to and home took off on time. The plane was clean, seats comfortable - not much leg room but when is there! Sweets given out on both legs of journey for landing and blankets if you were cold, snacks and drinks just as good as any other low cost airline - maybe cheaper. The cabin crew were happy and liked a chat with the passengers.',\n",
       " 'Flew Melbourne to Bangkok return in economy. Melbourne to Bangkok: Hot towels were given out after take off, a drinks round and then dinner was served. Food was decent for economy class. Good choice of inflight entertainment.  Cabin crew were polite and friendly and did their jobs to a high standard. Drinks offered many times by staff, and drinks were available in the galley as well. Breakfast served before landing. Bangkok to Melbourne: Much the same as the in bound flight, crew excellent and several drink rounds were offered. However had to take shuttle bus from terminal to the plane even though the aerobridge was not in use.',\n",
       " 'London Bangkok Business class. First time in Silk class (Business) on the upper deck of Boeing 747-400. The cabin felt jaded, but in a few days this route will be using the A380, so you can see why Thai Airways are not investing on this aircraft. The inflight service was friendly and efficient, though breakfast felt a bit rushed. Will be interesting to see how the A380 compares on my return.',\n",
       " 'Travelled with family for a holiday in Skiathos. Great flights on both directions. Outbound flight left on time with friendly and professional cabin crew. Breakfast was delicious with sausage, bacon, omelette, tomato compote, yoghurt, banana and maple muffin and orange juice. Landed at Skiathos around 15 minutes early. Our inbound flight back to Stansted was around 45 minutes late. This was apparently due to one of the pilots originally scheduled for the flight from Stansted being taken ill and a relief pilot needing to take his place. On this flight we had a choice of Beef Hickory of Tandoori Chicken. I choose the Tandoori Chicken, which was tasty. The cabin crew on this flight were also friendly and professional. Despite the delay, we managed to make up lost time and landed back at Stansted only 5 minutes late. Thomas Cook Airlines have certainly improved their image since I last flew with them, which was around 2008. ',\n",
       " \"My partner and I just returned from a long-haul flight to Orlando and travelled both ways in the refurbished Premium Cabin.  The cabin interior mirrors the new livery. The first two hours including priority check-in, fast track security and priority boarding worked like a dream and we were relaxing in our seats with a glass of bubbles and some nibbles before we knew it. The cabin staff were welcoming, professional and friendly. The new seats are wide enough for most shapes and sizes and the legroom affords a very comfortable flight. Complimentary newspapers,  Marie Claire and inflight magazine available. A drink service and wine service before dinner is served. The James Martin lunch offering was some of the tastiest airline food we've had, followed by ice cream and a cream tea before arrival.  Priortiy Bag Collection and it took only 30 minutes before we were picking up our rental car. The return trip was of comparable quality and we would thank Thomas Cook for taking good care of us.\",\n",
       " \"EDI to BCN on 18th June and BCN to EDI on the 27th. Excellent fare with Vueling. Flight left on time. Lovely crew and free choice of drinks and food from the menu. Return flight from Barcelona includes priority check in, fast track security, access to business lounge and priority boarding. Drink before take off and unlimited free food and drink during the flight and arrived on time. Can't really fault the service and was concerned about flying with Vueling due to previous bad reviews. Already booked up for another flight to Barcelona in September. Very impressed!\",\n",
       " \"Two wonderful flights with engaging and helpful crews. Check in agent a little off hand and only issued connecting boarding pass for one of us. LAX Star Alliance lounge run by Air NZ much more pleasant then the old T2 lounge, NZ 5 flight left on time, meals and wines excellent. Slept very well. Connected with NZ 135 also left on time and Auckland lounge was good, food better that usual for breakfast although didn't need more than a snack. Flight to Brisbane equally competent. IFE on both excellent choice although only had the new system on NZ 5 which is a vast improvement on the old one. Bags off promptly and out of the airport in 15 minutes.\",\n",
       " 'Took an evening flight with Air Serbia from Vienna to Bucharest via Belgrade. The flight was in a relatively small turbo-prop aircraft. I had a seat on the front with no one next to me, I also had about half a metre of leg space which was brilliant. Cabin crew very friendly and talkative, as it was a short hop I ended up talking with one of the stewardesses and a man on the opposite row about travel/politics for the entire flights. I would fly again.',\n",
       " \"American Airlines has improved for US domestic travel. I would say 90% of staff encounters I have are upbeat, courteous and professional.  I don't know how it's going to be after US Air is fully integrated, but for now I am happy with the new planes, mostly professional FA's, helpful gate agents. There's a tiny part of me that's tempted to try them on an overseas flight, but maybe that's a bridge too far.\",\n",
       " 'Great airline, best staff ever. Very professional ground staff in Vienna airport. Definitely recommend to my friends.',\n",
       " 'Zagreb to Vienna we flew with Dash Q400. Small and noisy aircraft but it is just 45 minute flight. The seats are narrow and I felt very uncomfortable. We got water and snacks. Vienna to Rome we flew with A320, the seats are more comfortable. Although the flight was also short (1,5 hours) they show some short movies or flight plan. We got water, coffee, wine and snacks. On both flights the cabin crew was very polite and helpful.',\n",
       " 'Flight home was as good as the flight out. Had long delay to depart, in part from a missing passenger who checked in, then disappeared - one of those mysteries about airline travel that happens from time to time.  Meanwhile a full plane of passengers were delayed in total by 90 mins. A320 was newly refurbished and clean. So called \"new\" Club Europe seats were installed, and as I was in row 1 it was okay. The menu was identical to the outbound and the beef main course was was terrific. It was the sort of meal that I would have happily paid 짙20 for in a quality bistro. FAs were great. The Chinese FA was the sort that understand customer service. Her colleague was closer to retirement and seemed to be on another planet most of the time. At the half way point I wanted another gin and tonic, but they had run out of both ice and proper \"glasses\". On arrival to LHR we were parked miles away from the Terminal. No reasons was given. All in all, a very good experience.',\n",
       " 'Once boarded there was a technical fault with air conditioning and the cabin got very hot. The cabin crew did offer cold water to keep all passengers cool, and delay was only around 20 minutes. Once airborne, drinks and snacks were served. Seating on A319 was comfortable for a short flight. At GLA Airport the parking stands  are so far away from the main terminal and pick up points, and changes to the airport in the past couple of years have increased the walking distance. This is annoying if you only have hand luggage and want a quick getaway, especially on a late night arrival. One sees Easyjet and Ryanair passengers passing through the arrivals process much quicker.',\n",
       " \"Booking was easy, free seat selection and 23kg luggage included. Needed to register sports equipment and it was done by phone. Mobile check-in done using Miles&More app as Croatia Airlines uses Lufthansa check-in BCN. Croatia Airlines flies from non-Schengen gates E so nothing to do there as only one cafeteria, a small Duty-Free stand with very limited choices. Boarding on time, FAs welcoming us on board. Seat pitch is around 32 inches. Inflight magazine has lots of photos and articles to help pass time onboard. Small complimentary snack and drinks service and then later offered items from BOB program. Prices for BOB were triple than in the supermarket. We landed on time, customs cleared in 2', luggage delivered in 7'.\",\n",
       " 'Birmingham to Lyon return on Embraer 175, a comfortable aircraft. Crew pleasant enough  on both sectors, did what they had to do with a smile. This airline does have a reputation for bad time keeping. As usual on arrival into Birmingham had the usual wait for a gate and steps, they never seem ready for a plane coming in, it\\'s as if the plane has \"popped in\" unannounced, and then the usual long wait for luggage. As Flybe have a large network out of Birmingham, they should be kicking a few butts at BHX, it certainly lags behind the likes of Manchester airport.',\n",
       " \"Booking was easy. Paid 162??for BCN-MAD return. Booked Classica fare which include 23kg hold luggage and seat selection. Both flights departure time changed to 1h later but informed on time and accepted changes. Online check-in done using Iberia's mobile app, luggage drop-off was friendly and fast. Welcomed on board by well presented crew, cabin on both flights clean and in good condition. Seat pitch as expected, tad larger than Vueling but enough that my knees do not touch seat in front like on Vueling flights. FA's smiling and professional, assisting with luggage. Arrivals on time or a bit earlier. Did not buy anything from BOB but prices were comparable with other cariers with similar business model. Very nice inflight magazine. Luggage delivered in average times for both airports, BCN always longer. First time with Iberia and a very positive experience.\",\n",
       " 'Excellent service on board, seat and bed very good, 3 point harness safety belt (like in your car) during take-off and landing! Entertainment weak, a lot of films but hardly any blockbusters, very poor Flightmap with little information content.  Escorted in LAX from check in to lounge, but they did did not know where the Star Alliance lounge is.',\n",
       " 'Flight departed 10 minutes lat. Service was efficient and a snack and drinks were served for the 1 hour flight. Overall experience was good but the seat was torture with no padding and what I assume was a metal rod in the lumbar region.',\n",
       " 'Reasonable legroom, and the food was quite good for economy, with adequate portions. Wine was okay. Entertainment system had good screen and plenty of choices. Cabin staff were polite and efficient. Baggage transfer between flights at KUL and final delivery at Hong Kong was also fine. A smooth, good value experience.',\n",
       " 'Flew the A380. Boarding was very effici챘nt and shortly after take off drinks and meals were served. So there was enough time to sleep for the remaining flight time. I decided to get a last drink in the lounge. There I had a wonderful reception by the crew, who were nice to chat and pamper for the rest of the remaining flight. I did not sleep a wink, but had my best flight experience ever! Qatar Airways serves an outstanding business class product with incredible good seats and the lounge on the A380 as an absolute extra, but at the end of the day it are the people who are working for Qatar, who make it a 6 star rating.',\n",
       " 'Dallas to Doha economy class, and passengers were mostly not beef eaters, but one of the main dishes offered was beef. Maybe the airline should look at other food choice options. Overall very satisfied with the service provided by crew and the inflight entertainment. Qatar deserves to be the world best airline. Meal options are not the fault of crew, but just a suggestion.',\n",
       " \"I was pleasantly surprised by the refurbished cabin. Changed from a 2-2-2 seat configuration in Business class to a 1-2-1 configuration, SAS has taken a huge leap forward in terms of the product for premium passengers. Seats now full flat, all with aisle access. Excellent service with a great variety of food. Breakfast had a very good choice of options. The new cabin lighting offers a special feeling. Free wifi works but can be slow sometimes. When all their long haul fleet is renovated (at present A330's have been refurbished) SAS will offer a very competitive product on their intercontinental routes. \",\n",
       " 'Booked the flight one day before with a very good offer. Online Check-in was not great as no seat selection possible (may be due to the fact that you will be redirected to the LH online check-In). Reserved for the LIS-ZRH flight online a window seat against additional charge, however this was not considered at Check-In and they offered me a middle seat!! Flight was late out of LIS, just 20 minutes for the transfer to MUC, but baggage made it. Crews generally friendly, cold snack (nothing worth to write about it) served on the longer routes. On the LIS-ZRH route we had the retrofitted A320 with 37 rows : very cramped and especially the toillets in the rear are small! Airline recommended especially with the smooth transfer at ZRH airpot',\n",
       " \"European flights are a breeze and flying through Zurich airport is almost a must! On my flight to Sao Paulo the A340 is still in good condition, staff helpful and polite and the food very tasteful. The seats still have the Swiss dark brown and light panel wood and  having single seats is very appealing. The only downside is the flight entertainment system. It is starting to show its age. Compared with some other airlines the Swiss Business Class screen of 12 inch doesn't compare to what is on the market. If you choose to watch films with a dark background most of the detail in the film escapes the eye. It is almost difficult to watch and for long flights a good screen is important. I hope that with the new Boeing 777's coming in 2016 they will decide on a new system for video/audio. If the entertainment system would have been top notch then I would have given the 10/10 but seeing as this a real bother I decided not to give full marks.\",\n",
       " 'Thai Airways offered the most direct route from Singapore to Islamabad and the timing is good too. Onboard meal service and inflight entertainment option are good. I enjoy the flights both to and from Islamabad. Only small problems the flight does not operate on a Sunday and price tend to be expensive for this route. It is even more expensive than flying to Europe return. Other than that, I am happy with the flights. The route and connectivity of Thai Airways are very extensive, it can compete with other major airlines if only the price is comparable to others. The same route by Qatar Airways or Emirates always ended up cheaper during the sale time, compared to Thai Airways. Considering Thai Airways using older aircrafts compared to these airlines, the fares must be made competitive.',\n",

Zagreb, Brussels 15-20 mins, Athens, Bucharest all 20 mins), my luggage and boxes are delivered around 20 minutes after landing. For inbound flights with arrival in IST Ataturk airport the delivery takes over 30-45 minutes. This week I arrived from Sofia and had to wait 55 minutes to get my as Priority signed oversize luggage.

All staff was courteous, pleasant and efficient. WiFi entertainment system that streams TV and movies over tablets worked well, and provided lots of options. No problem finding my flights. The planes are so packed (this is industry wide, not just United) there's no flexibility in the system for weather delays. This also makes them uncomfortable. When I got annoyed enough that I tried three times to upgrade to Premium Economy hoping to score an empty center seat, United's App steadfastly refused to take my money, so I stayed wedged back in the back of the plane. Would I recommend United? Yes. They're no worse than any other carrier.  The benefit of United though, is you can get their service at more locations than just about any other airline. Using the smaller, regional airports like Harrisburg saves a lot of airport headaches - that's what gives United the leg up over other carriers for me.\",\n",

Outbound flight left slightly late but arrived 15 min early but return flight left an hour late due to overbooking and missing passengers as we were told. Due to overbooking of economy class, business class was full on return flight. It seems to me that upgrades were not given to Finnair plus tier or oneworld tier members but on a random basis. There should be a system that honors frequens fliers over the others. I know this is one thing that irritates most for higher Finnair plus tier members, and Finnair is losing these customers. Seats are full-flat but slightly narrow for sleeping. Nice pillow and good duvet and both were clean on both flights. Service was good, as it should be in business class. On return flight service was even better due to purser's efforts to deliver more personal service. Extra credit for that. Food was better for outbound flight. The main course was pretty good for airline meals. The dessert selection is Finnair's weak point for sure. There's an ice cream which are tiny prepacked cups of H채agen-Dazs or Macarons for example. Entertainment system has been upgraded and selection is better but still lacking behind of many airlines. Why can't there be a separate bus for business class passangers when there's a bus gate arrival in HEL?\",\n",

They have upgraded their old entertainment system to something on par with AF/BA/KLM now, however that is only in the renovated planes. The food is as bad as it was, but I'd say that for the price this is to be expected. I never have any expectations regarding the food they will serve so I'm not disapointed. They are usually still the cheapest for CDG to YUL so if I wanted something a tad better I'd pay a bit more.

The A380 was so much better, nice and spacious and seats very comfortable. IFE is not very different to Emirates or Singapore Airlines that I flew last time, don't understand why everyone raves about Emirates because they just have a huge library of ancient, 2nd rate films. Food was good, not the best but certainly good for Economy cabin trip. Cabin staff were great on both flights, better for DOH-BKK where they were chatty and friendly.

It was a wonderful way to pass 2 hours trying this and that. Boarding was easy. Economy and business passengers were divided. Sri Lankan offers flat bed business seats to most flights including this, so it was a luxury experience. Champagne was offered and meals ordered before take off. In flight service was perfect. Prior to the meal we were served sherry and cashews. The meals were wonderful. Plenty of choice. SriLankan has upgraded the inflight entertainment to offer 100+ channels. So it matches most airlines. But surpasses many airlines in terms of friendly service. Lunch was 4 courses, but more if you wished. Drinks included wines, spirits, sherries, port and liqueur. Excellent tea! Departure on time and arrival on time. Bags took a while to arrive, but that is outside the control of the airline. Overall perfection!',\n",
       " \"Legroom is typical but seats and plane was comfortable enough. The seats were leather, no inflight entertainment but the flight was only 2hrs 35mins. The meal was amusing it consited of scrambled egg, tinned tomato and a muffin. It was free though so I couldn't complain. I enjoyed it well enough.  The cabin crew were attentive and polite, I found check in was easy and the A321 was fairly quiet. \",\n",
       " \"The aircraft was great, plenty of leg room etc, films great and staff attentive. However, the meals were not brilliant. I requested a Gluten free meal as I am coeliac. I got the said meal but where was the chef's imagination for this special dietery food? My main dinner was ok but why  do we always get served a seeded brown roll? Where were the gluten free crackers to go with the cheese? And why do we always get a hard green apple? My family all had 'normal' food - lucky them, crackers for cheese and cheesecake dessert. I know there are Gluten free crackers around and I also know there are individual pot desserts. Breakfast was a yoghurt a fruit drink and a muffin, why couldn't I have a white bread roll with jam and butter and the muffin and juice? On a good note my family thoroughly enjoyed their meals.\",\n",
       " 'A surprisingly pleasant trip. Cabin service was very good and food was good as well. Seats were very comfortable with a nice selection movies available. The internet worked well, reasonably fast and did not lose signal the entire trip. We had seats 16J/K on the upper deck and it was very private and quiet up there.',\n",
       " ' The aircraft was fairly new and comfortable and food was good. The cabin service was rather low - not poor but not good either. The good part was that the air in the Boeing 787 seems to be a little more moist and the pressure was like being at a lower altitude. They said that internet service was available but all you could connect to was united.com so I gave that a fail mark.',\n",

The seats were comfortable compared to economy. Good inflight entertainment, food was average. Seats were comfortable as the layout was 2-3-2 in a widebody plane. The flight was on time on both legs. In-flight and ground staff were polite and helpful. No special treatment for Premium class passengers in terms of food.',\n",

Out of Manila airport in 20 minutes and arrived in the hotel within 1 hour after landing.',\n",
       " \"Have flown Etihad for many years. My last trip has made me somewhat less enthusiastic. Issues started when I went to KL Ticket Office to change my flights. They changed flights for GBP300 per seat, used to be GBP175 and told me I could no longer have a car from Heathrow to my home at the end of the journey. I explained that I was offered a car when I made the booking, but they said the fare rules had now changed and I was no longer entitled a car. After much complaining and nearly an hour waiting I finally got to speak with the local General Manager. I again stressed I had been offered a car when the booking was made, so I felt they could not simply change the rules. Eventually after 4 days of back and to emails, they confirmed the car from Heathrow. Check in is always a disaster, ditto the Lounge they use. With a couple of flights a day and now with First Class they should either choose a new partner or open their own lounge. The Emirates Lounge is fantastic at KLIA. Flights okay, service and quality of food definitely on the down swing. It's okay but used to be great. Bigger planes mean less attention for passengers which is were Etihad scored in the past. A re-think maybe, before Qatar Airways or Emirates (even BA) start to steal your premium passengers on this route.\",\n",
       " \"London City to Exeter and back. Flybe online check in system is fantastic, once you have checked in and printed your boarding pass at home you walk into the airport and straight to security swiftly and with ease. Both flights on time, on one of Flybe's new Dash8 Q400 acquisitions from United Express featuring the NextGen style of cabin. Cabin clean and comfortable with a good amount of leg room for a budget carrier. A good choice of snacks and drinks for such a short flight but these are well overpriced. Cabin crew were polite and helpful although once they complete cabin service during the first few minutes of the flight you won't see or hear from them again until the descent begins, so this can be annoying if you require anything extra. Would recommend Flybe and would also recommend flying on the Dash 8, even though it's a propeller plane the takeoff and landing is quite an enjoyable and different experience compared to most jet powered aircraft.\",\n",
       " \"Boeing 777 clean and spacious, 3-3-3 seat configuration. Friendly and polite flight attendants. Boarding at Jakarta was organized, old/disabled/family with young children got priority boarding. Entertainment excellent, feature films including some Indonesian titles. Screen a little non sensitive though, the Boeing 737 of Garuda had better touch screen. The downside of the flight was the food.  The lavatory was clean and amenities well stocked. Wifi connection was onboard for a charge of 12 USD. Didn't try it.\",\n",
       " 'Nice to have Boeing 787 on this short flight instead of usual old 737. However the seats in Economy are very narrow with quite limited legroom. If you are over 180cm/6 ft tall, you may find it very uncomfortable. LOT has a food for purchase in Economy, but selection is quite good (sandwiches, salads, snacks, hot meals), and soft and alcoholic drinks. Eveything is cheap, and for large sandwich, beer and coffee I paid 28 PLN, which is 6 Euro/9 USD. Water and chocolate wafer is for free. Good IFE with around 40 movies and many tv shows. The only downpoint of this flight was some cabin crew. Some were nice and smiling, some looked very grumpy, with basic English skills or not talkative at all, answering with \"no\", \"yes\" only. Sometimes the word \"please\" would be apreciated. Generally, good flight, but some cabin crew must remember who pays their salaries and treat us with respect.',\n",
       " 'FRA to TLV. Arrived with LH train ticket via high-speed train in Frankfurt. On check in I asked for upgrade, since I have more than enough miles. Upgrade was granted and walked to their lounge in terminal C close to gate 14. This lounge looks like a more basic lounge and as it was before 10a,m the selection seemed limited. But after one hour we boarded the A321 for Tel Aviv. The plane is a basic Lufthansa plane for short haul, so there are no special Business class seats, only the middle seat is free, which gives you no more legroom. The crew was nice and served a pre-drink, as the flight was about 20 minutes late, due to high traffic in the air. Soon after take-off they served a nice Gin and Tonic with nuts. After that they started the food service on a tray. The food was nice with starter, salad, main dish and fruits. After that they served coffee and chocolate. The crew was fab and always smiling and doing a really good job.',\n",

KUL-HKG inflight service was nice, good selection of food/wine. Need improvement on IFE (old and bad headset). Ground staff was friendly, speedy check-in for Enrich Silver Member at dedicated counter at KLIA, priority boarding was announced too. FA are friendly and smile, addressed me by name and chatty. Seat was so so, a bit hard and not reclining to a proper flat bed. Inbound HKG-KUL was fine at first, boarded aircraft but  delayed 1hr and then delayed another hour due to techincal problem. Hence I missed my connecting flight KUL-SIN. Approached ground staff, requested to access to the Golden Lounge (I fly Economy class for my inbound leg) but got rejected, but was given meal vouchers to spend for dinner. I would fly again with Malaysia Airlines.',\n",
       " 'Malaysia Airlines need to control customer hand carry baggage, all of the overhead bin was full and the passenger next to me was sitting with all of their belongings (4 bags). The food quality and portion was acceptable and delicious. Seat is comfortable but the legroom was limited when the passenger in front reclines. The IFE can be better if Malaysia Airlines change their poor earphone.',\n",
       " \"This was a mix of business and economy. Business class SIN to DOH and Economy class thereafter. I was a little disappointed I wasn't able to have a pre-departure glass of Champagne due to customs regulations at Singapore. Once in the air I was able to enjoy a glass. The usual business class service from Qatar Airways was enjoyable even though the flight was bumpy all the way from SIN to DOH. The flatbed was comfortable and a sleepsuit was provided. Back in economy class for DOH to LHR leg. Nice service and the flight was empty so I was able to enjoy a row of seats to myself even if the IFE box was does restrict legroom.\",\n",
       " \"I choose this route so I could fly the A350. The first sector was cramped on the B787 but the service and entertainment onboard was up to the usual standard for Qatar Airways. Once onboard the A350 the leg room and width of the seat was obvious. I was able to stretch out, without irritating my neighbour. The food portions in economy have shrunk but they're enough to keep you going on both these sectors which are just over 7 hours each. The entertainment system on the A350 is also superior to all the others in their fleet.\",\n",

       " 'Outbound Seats 29A/B, return Seats 4A/B. Very happy with both sets of seats on pitch and width. Staff very slow both ways in providing food and drink for a 3 hour flight, also they do not seem to stock enough food for both ways. Both out and return the aircraft had in flight entertainment fitted but used for flight map only, it would have been nice to have a film. Thomson seem to be reluctant to invoke their own conditions on seating rules, there was at least one passenger who did not comply and I felt very sorry for the person who had to sit next to them.',\n",

Extremely slow check in at Dublin. Comfortable seats on both flights with ample legroom. Decent food and numerous drinks rounds. Hats off for the fact that luggage arrived in Belgrade with such a short transfer time. Surprised to see a boxed pet cat in the cabin on the Dub-Ist flight! Would use again and recommend.',\n",

       " 'YYZ to ZRH on Boeing 787 in economy with my wife and infant. Check in staff in Toronto very helpful and the line moved quickly. Boarding and flight departure on time. I am 6\\'4\" and flying economy I was worried about leg room as I was unable to reserve a preferred seat. Air Canada Boeing 787 cabin was clean and felt open with the lighting and larger windows. I was surprised at the amount of leg room there was in an economy seat, as so many people have stated it was poor. My knees did touch the seat in front of myself however I was able to extend them under the seat with no problem. My wife being much shorter had plenty of room. I would suggest when travelling with an infant to take advantage of the bassinet seat as we did on the return flight. The seats are slightly narrow. The inflight entertainent was great having your own personal screen to watch numerous movies and TV shows. The only issue with these is that there is a \"remote\" control located on the arm rests. The buttons are usually pressed by the person sitting beside you which will cause your seat light and functions on the entertainment screen to be activated (sucks when watching a movies and volume keeps going up and down). The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful and service with a smile. Our first flight they even attempted to have people give up the bassinet seat to allow us to sit there. We had a great expirence flying with AC and will use them again in the future for sure. And on a side note the pasta served for the meal is much better than the chicken.',\n",

IFE screens had a good quality but the options were extremely limited and I got bored quickly. They listed each movie and the different languages it was in as separate movie, so it looked like they had a lot of movies but in reality, it was just the same movie listed over and over again. Service from the ground to the air, however, was flawless. Staff were warm, friendly, welcome and every request was honored with a smile. Although, like most Asian airlines, they are a bit reserved and robotic. Food was a little bit small but the quality was great. NRT-MNL on the 767 with older but more comfortable seats. Flight attendants on this flight were even more friendly and food was also better. Overall, a pleasant experience, although it's disappointing that they now have 10-abreast on some of their 77Ws.\",\n",
       " 'EDI-LCY on Embraer 190 operated by BA City Flyer in Economy ??short domestic hop back to London City Airport. Flight departed on time but could not land at City due to high winds. Pilot tried twice but had to abort the landing and finally diverted to London Southend. During the whole time good information from the flight deck about what was going on. Once the plane landed in Southend, crew was well prepared giving out information during the disembarkation process about the options. Basically, passengers could use a coach to be organized by BA to LCY or people could opt to take public transport to London and have the costs reimbursed later. We opted for the Greater Anglia service to Liverpool Street Station which runs regularly and worked well for us. As for the regular service on board, full bar service and snacks were offered. FA?셲 were friendly. Service in Edinburgh was hassle free. We had no checked luggage and check in kiosks worked fine with no lines. Terraces Lounge in EDI was quite spacious and comfortable with some food and a nice selection of drinks. Excellent for a regional airport. Especially given the fact that the situation was weather related and clearly not BA?셲 fault, I felt that BA did everything possible to make the experience as hassle free as possible. Situations like these, when not everything goes as planned, tell a good airline apart from the rest.  While the actual reclaiming process over BA?셲 website took longer and was less straightforward than expected, it finally worked and the difficulties involved were related BA?셲 procedures and information regarding requirements posted on the website. However, the agents worked with us to finish the claim and were actually helpful during the process . (Oneworld Sapphire)',\n",

My carry on didn\\'t fit in bin (upper deck, small bins), the flight attendent sent me to her colleagues in the back, but they were too busy, so I left the suitcase in the aisle, and it took about 30 minutes for someone to take care of it - not a very friendly experience in general. No particular attention to passengers asking about drinks, and serving wasn\\'t good - food served with foil cover labeled \"remove before serving\", etc. I felt like I was in economy premium, rather than business. What mattered was the lie flat and the ability to sleep, but at this price, even for a discounted upgrade, it\\'s not worth it.',\n",

Food was reasonable, the wine list impressive and chocolates given out after dessert and coffee. Boeing 772LR from DOH to PHL was much better, more spacious and better seat width. Catering was on demand and staff were warmer this time around and did their job splendidly, although they should chill champagne and white wine properly. The attendant laid out the flat bed on the 772 and provided all passengers with PJ's, a comfy pillow and a duvet. On all flights, the toilets were kept clean, food was served warm, good brewed coffee served and the in flight entertainment was adequate. Great multinational crew which is a plus with this airline. I would highly recommend this airline.\",\n",

Except for the idea of flying in an unusually large aircraft, I did not feel anything special during the trip. In the economy section of the A380 there are only 2 toilets given the number of passengers in each section of the aircraft. The toilet I used for the flight CDG-SIN had a clogged wash basin! Food service nothing remarkable, rolls  are very ordinary. The only thing that perked up these meals were the ice cream bars served as dessert. Check in service in Manila for the outbound flights to Paris was good - efficient and courteous. It was the opposite in Paris for the return. The check in staff was rude. The same thing with the security staff who man the line of passengers reporting for check in. They \"manage\" this long line by cutting it up into two and bringing later-arriving passengers to a separate line that, in effect, let\\'s them jump unjustly over passengers who came earlier. This is an irksome experience from an airline that prides itself in being the best. A strong point though on my flights was the inflight entertainment, Krisworld, which offers countless choices.

The food selection was good, and options available also good - we could not fault the service.

I think I agree with the review by M Brown on the 20th March, people are being are rather unfair particularly with regards to the catering situation on Icelandair - they are very clear on what the product being offered here is and there is opportunity once booked to add food from the regular menu at a discount before flying and this is served to you before the main food service begins. I only pre-ordered food outbound on the long-haul KEF-PDX sector and found what was served to be delicious and good value. All non-alcoholic drinks are complimentary and can be requested at any time during the flight. All sectors were on B757, which whilst relatively old were immaculately maintained. Outbound from Gatwick the plane was a bit older and had no IFE, but this was ok for the short flight to Reykjav챠k and I was notified 24hrs prior to departure of this via text. On the long-haul sector from Keflav챠k to Portland the aircraft was more the Icelandair standard product and we were presented with bottle of Icelandic water which was a nice touch. There was IFE on this sector but it was very old, with poor quality picture and didn't have a fantastic selection - but I had brought my own entertainment with me anyway. The staff however on this flight were fantastic and really worked hard to be friendly and attentive to passengers needs so much so I will be writing to Icelandair to tell them so! Flying back to Reykjav챠k was pleasant with blankets and cushions provided for this overnight sector and IFE was newer and the the best of all the sectors with a clear picture. My return to London a few days later was also fine with everything on schedule and generally pleasant. One thing that didn't work on any sector was mobile boarding passes - this didn't work on a single sector for me, but I easily received a paper version in most cases. Apart from little niggles which made the experience less than perfect overall I was satisfied with my experience, it was fantastic value for money with the added plus of the stopover and would be very happy to use them again.\",\n",

Service is good, lunch is good (even special vegetarian meal), entertainment system is available and with a large choice. And the Russian hospitality is smiling and attentive to the guests. Had a good time on the first part of my trip. Changed planes in Moscow. Priority lane works well if the connecting flight is with Aeroflot. Moscow-Ulan Bator left on time. Seats on the Boeing 737-800 are only to be used for short distances, less than 4 hours. Mine was a medium haul flight of 6 hours. A night flight with chairs not to be used for sleeping. No real business class flat bed seat on these planes. A great pity. The service is good, dinner/breakfast is good (even the special meal for a vegetarian), entertainment system is available and with a large choice . And the Russian hospitality was once more smiling and attentive to the guests. The seats on the second flight let them down. The rest was a good experience.',\n",

Cramped conditions in the HS748 aside, the service overall was pretty good - staff were (almost) all friendly and efficient, flights ran on schedule, and reasonable food was provided.

A380 has an excellent entertainment system which has many movies in CC .This is an extreme plus for me since I am deaf. The washrooms were cleaned. The food was excellent with ample choices.

Their inflight entertainment was good and the new soft neck pillow was a nice touch to help sleep during the long flight. I found that the food quality has deteriorated considerably from last time I traveled Etihad, not too long ago. The portions were small and the food was not tasty. Just before landing a muffin was offered with tea or coffee. This seems that the airline is cutting cost on their food. The crew seemed to be friendly and attentive. The transfer of passengers from the plane in Abu Dhabi to the main arrival hall in a bus is very uncomfortable because in sweltering heat it is hard to walk up to the bus especially for the elderly. I hope Etihad takes into account these points if they care for the economy passengers.',\n",

Staff were friendly and professional throughout. In-flight food is purchase-only and expensive by Indian standards (although they will provide free drinking water) - a word of caution about pre-ordering, if you take up the 250Rs pre-paid option you could end up losing money, depending on your choice of food/drink. Also it appears they load up food and drink at the start of the day, and some options (e.g. Jaljeera juice) seem to consistently run out.

The flight from Istanbul was another story. The gate was changed 15 minutes prior to departure. After delay of about half an hour and while the passengers on this full 737-800 were standing for a long time at the new gate, only one staff was taking care of boarding which took a long time and a lot of agony on behalf of passengers to complete. The aircraft was a ?쐍ew interior??Boeing 737-800. Again, only one flight attendant was serving the first 12 or so rows which clearly is more than what they usually suppose to handle.

The long haul flights had pillows, blankets and headsets prepared on each seat. Three meals were provided with some choice and were decent by airline standards. A glass of wine was included with the main meal. Water was offered on a regular basis. Tea, coffee and soft drinks also available. Good selection of Chinese, International and Hollywood movies as well as games, e-books and other entertainment. On arrival in Shanghai Pudong we learnt that our ongoing flight to Beijing had been cancelled due to bad weather. Although we were transferred to an earlier flight we had to collect our luggage and collect new boarding passes which had already been prepared. This process was somewhat confusing and the boarding passes lay on the counter like a deck of cards with passengers randomly going through them to find their own. The information board showed that the new flight was delayed with no ETD or whether it would even be leaving that day. A rep came to explain the situation. He spent 10 minutes giving a Chinese explanation and in English, simply said we do not know. Suddenly he received a call on his mobile and said we may be boarding. After a mad rush to the gate it transpired that this was not the case after all and everyone returned to what seats were available, or the floor. Half an hour later the flight was officially called and we were on our way. The shorter, domestic flights offer food service but no entertainment. On one occasion we experienced a 2 hour delay after we had boarded the plane, due to a sudden storm. Dinner was served during this delay, before take off, and was a good use of time. I do not know what the flights cost as they were part of a tour package, but based on service and comfort I would recommend China Eastern Airlines.\",\n",

Offered a bar service as well as fresh fruit on the short sector to Zhengzhou and the aircraft stops here before carrying on to Shanghai. Transit process well organised and offered lounge usage - again, Chinese standard and WiFi (which is all I really needed) did not work. Staff were proactive and did try to resolve but not much else they could do. Full meal service on the second sector to SHA - proper menus and 3 entr챕e choices, whilst all Chinese were fairly agreeable to a western palate. Food quality was good and regular beverage services. Staff were proactive during both flights and language skills were decent for a domestic service. For the price paid and what you get it puts many legacy European \"Business Class\" services to shame.',\n",

Boarding was orderly in both directions. Lunch was a large salad. However, only one choice. It was a Salmon Salad. Quite a few of passengers turned it down, including me. I was surprised there were not at least 2 choices. Once again First class FA was great.

       " \"As a frequent Chicago-Beijing-route traveller, I know the available carriers quite well, Hainan, United, and American Airlines. Hainan flies this route with its Boeing 787. One thing I love the most about Hainan is that the toilets are always clean! Trust me when I say the sanitary condition of cabin toilets are important for people spending 12 hours or more on international flights, because you will use the toilets at least once. I was sitting in 40K, which is the first role of the second section of the Economy class cabin, and I saw the flight attendants cleaning the toilets on an hourly basis with air freshener. Although I was a little disappointed when Hainan changed its breakfast menu (it used to offer omelet and sausage on all international flights, which I think is the best in-flight breakfast I have ever had!), the food is still pretty nice and superior to other carriers. The flight also offers a self-service snack and beverage bar at the back. And if you have special requests, the flight attendants are always there to provide you with whatever you need. Inflight Entertainment, Hainan still has a long way to go. But I don't see it as a problem, because compared with the entertainment systems on other carriers (Air China, American Airlines, United, Delta, Air Canada), Hainan's still far more superior. Many hit shows and sitcoms are included.  One weakness which Hainan and all Chinese airlines all have is the language service. Although the captain spoke perfectly fluent English, some cabin members didn't. Foreigners may face difficulty understanding their safety instruction or communicating their needs. They still need to work on that.\",\n",

The check in gate for the connecting flight had closed and the ground staff could have asked me to carry my own luggage but instead helped arrange for my luggage to be brought up the plane by the airport staff, and gave me good and clear instructions on how to get to the domestic terminal. My return flight from Osaka to Tokyo was supposed to be at Kansai Airport, but I overlooked it and went to Itami instead. The ground staff at Itami helped arrange my partner and I to be on the next flight out from Itami to Haneda, even though they could have asked me to travel to Kansai for my flight instead. The seating space was just okay, nothing to commend or complain about. Choice of shows and movies in the inflight entertainment was a little low, not as many choices as other airlines I've flown.

Service quality by the staff (attitude, promptness and helpfulness) was 4 out of 5. As for meals I was highly impressed because of their setting.  Metal cutlery (not plastic), menu to read, delicate desserts, and nice dishware. Other than that, the food is OK, the dinner being good while breakfast was  poor.

This past May we flew again to the US with United. I have to admit that this time I was concerned as I had read many bad reviews about the airline. We had also requested upgrades on all flights to Business First and had been approved on our outward and return flights. Then my fears were realised when one hour after checking in online for our flight to SFO I received an email informing me the flight had been cancelled due to the inability to find a crew to fly the plane from SFO to Sydney. After a frantic call to United we were put on the LAX flight which left 2 hours earlier the next day. Of course we lost our upgrade but the customer service rep was good enough to put us in Economy Plus at no charge. Again my fears came back when we were at the airport to be informed that the flight was delayed due to the inbound flight being delayed at LAX. However that said the pilot was able to make up time in the air and we actually landed early in LAX and easily made our connecting flight to New York.

I am glad we were as rows 2,3 etc looked very cramped. The only difference with economy being the table tray in the centre - instead of a seat. Lunch was very good indeed. I had the Thai chicken - my wife had the cheeks of beef which she said was excellent. FAs were very friendly. Smooth flight all the way.

I felt a lot of pressure on my legs just to keep me on my seat. On this particular flight, the seats were configured 2-2-2, but I've flown this route before where the seats were configured 2-3-2 (worse). No privacy. The seats are not wide enough and are so close together that I could feel my neighbour's every move. You also have to share elbow space with your neighbour. When there are drinks on the elbow area, you have to stay upright so as not to hit two glasses on that same space. Since there is no storage, your neighbour's meal menu, magazine or iPad will also be in your space. This is awful for a 3-hour flight, unacceptable for business class, more fit for premium economy. The toilets are also cramped. This is really light years away from CX long haul business class. They use planes with business class cabins configured for long haul flights on the Hong Kong-Haneda route or the shorter Hong Kong-Manila route, surely they can do the same for the Hong Kong-Narita route.\",\n",

Flight back, though, was much more comfortable.

       " 'TIF DOH BKK, 10th June - Qatar remains my favorite airline and is way above the rest. TIF-DOH First class. I told the flight attendant what I wanted to eat from the menu where items required a choice, assuming that the rest of the menu would follow but all I got was I had selected from that section none of the other items came. The lounge in Doha is large and somewhat impersonal but excellent nevertheless. DOH-BKK Business Class, the crew apart seemed disinterested. Some passengers had finished their meal before others had started.  I guess what niggled me not being on the receiving end of top priority as I usually am. All in all OK service and flight. But Qatar normally is above OK and exceptional. I put it down to a bad day for both them and me. ',\n",
       " \"Check-in counters opened 2 hours before the flight and a queue formed as early as an hour before the counters opened. Being a PPS club member, was able to queue at business class queue even though I flew economy. The ground crew had a list of the names allowed to queue in the business class check in queue and those who were not flying business class or PPS club members were asked to queue in the economy class queue which made the line short. Ground crew and flight crew very friendly. Route was via Cebu and was invited to use the lounge in both Davao and Cebu which had decent food options. Flight crew very professional and friendly even though it was an almost full load in economy. One complaint is that they run out of food options early and those at the rear only had one choice of food left. Crew very apologetic but this is not the first time this happened on SilkAir (happened in my inbound leg to Davao too). Both food options were good though. Didn't try the entertainment system and most passengers chose to sleep through the flight. It was an enjoyable flight and am so glad that they have this very convenient connection between Singapore and Davao.\",\n",
       " \"Flew SIN - JNB on business, and in business class on SQ. Service to their usual high standard. Food out of SIN was very nice, food out of JNB was very average, but I assume that is dependant on what the local ground handlers can provide. Cabin clean enough and well maintained. SQ's lie flat seats - you either like them or you don't. I am in the latter category. Not supportive enough when seated, and too hard and with an odd angled lying position when flat. But this is old news and newer cabins are on their way. Main complaint was that this B777-200ER was a bit tired in terms of ICE (smallish screens with limited movie collection) and WIFI (there wasn't any!). The latter was a particular bugbear for me as the return flight was daytime, I planned to get some work done, but couldn't due to no WIFI connection. This isn't really good enough these days and SQ need to upgrade their fleet in that respect PDQ!\",\n",

Boarded the 5 year old aircraft, an A330-200, on time and in an organised manner. Within 30 minutes crew came through with a drinks run. Wine and soft drinks free, with a fee for spirits. Lunch followed and was very tasty. Small salad, main chicken dish with a nice desert. Nothing spectacular but very edible for airplane food. The crew, all but one, seemed happy and cheerful and interacted with the passengers as they came through the cabin. They came through the cabin with another juice and water run about an hour later and after that we got an expected treat of chocolate ice cream. About an hour before landing in Charlotte we were given a tasty paninni snack and cupcake with an offer of another drink or tea or coffee. The entertainment system worked well and had a good choice of movies. I honestly could not fault these guys with the way they delivered the service and how they made an 8 hour flight fly by!',\n",

The seats were comfortable and not tight. A hot meal was served in flight - no fee and a beverage was even included. This was on a three hour flight - a really nice touch. Unfortunately, my gluten free meal which had been ordered was not on board but the flight attendant provided a very nice salad and a sincere apology. All in all, we had a very enjoyable flight each time.',\n",

Fast forward to June 10, 2015, I flew Air France (AF 254) from Singapore to Jakarta and it was a smooth and comfortable experience. We boarded early, cabin crew was courteous and friendly, the inflight entertainment was superb with so many choices of programs and extremely easy-to-use touch screen.

I am 6\\'2\" tall and 315 lbs, they provided an extention without even a request for me and the tv/video screens were present and operational.

The cabin crew were very attentive and constantly taking rounds with water/ juice etc - very efficient crew.',\n",

The other one was kept sort of reserved for the premium economy passengers, so there was quite a queue at times. Some newspapers would have been beneficial.',\n",

OK, so the plane may be rather old, but it was in immaculate condition and the cabin crew (older, mostly British) delivered efficient professional and friendly service. The lie flat bed (I took a rear facing window seat) is excellent for sleeping and gives great privacy. The food offering was not amazing (some cost cutting here) and I was surprised to see nuts served in bags not on dishes. There was however a good selection of drinks and glasses were topped up as required. Inflight entertainment was excellent, with a great range of both movies and TV shows. I fly often with the middle eastern carriers who offer newer planes and a more luxury feel, however BA scored highly on crew, seat comfort and ease of sleeping. I also visited the Heathrow T3 arrivals lounge which is first class. I will definitely fly BA club world again if the price is competitive.',\n",

While the aircraft is starting to show its age, seats were reasonably comfortable - as long as you don't mind the unusual seating configuration where some passengers travel facing backwards. Cabin service and food quality were good - with one of the best breakfasts we have had in the air - a delicious fruit muesli followed by a 'full english' which was hot and tasty. On this overnight flight, sleep was difficult mainly due to the narrowness of the seats. BA should provide a mattress 'topper' as many other airlines offer to enhance sleep comfort. Fair value for money proposition.\",\n",

Meals on the whole were very nice but there still needs to be a bit of tweaking on the western menu. Our flights were mainly at night so didn't watch a lot of the entertainment system. Lounges at Auckland and Heathrow (T4) were very busy but very good. Lounge at Guangzhou not as good but adequate. I would fly China Southern again, especially for the competitive price we paid.\",\n",

As usual, the service is perfunctory, the food not bad in and out of Narita, the seat fairly comfortable, and the entertainment of good quality with lots of choices. No drama on either flight. My only complaint that has never been addressed properly with Delta over the years is the horrible state of the lavatories. They are always left to fester for entire flights. I have never once seen an FA go in one to clean one. Delta is not \"special\" compared to other international carriers, but it\\'s adequate and they have treated me well in the Skymiles program so far.',\n",
       " \"Flew out on a new A320 which had the new thin seats which proved to be very comfortable even on a 3.5 hour flight. There seemed to be more space generally so it was a good flight. Left early and arrived early. Check-in at Bristol was well organised with all check-in desks open so little waiting. A different story at Madeira airport. We queued for best part of an hour to check-in. The whole thing was a complete  shambles and there were some heated exchanges between passengers who tried to push in. We have seen this before at Madeira airport and it makes for a poor end to a nice holiday. Easyjet need to review their arrangements at this airport. The flight itself was uneventful on an older A320, left early and arrived early. The only slight disappointment was that there was only one refreshment run. Since they had run out of most snacks early on the first run perhaps they thought it wasn't worth doing a second (although a drink of some kind would have been welcome). Overall easyjet is my airline of choice when travelling in Europe as it is now on par with BA or other national carriers.\",\n",
       " \"EK863 and EK19 on 12 June and it was a seamless experience. I've been doing this route (or one to Birmingham) regularly for over 2 years now and appreciate the consistency of the service. The A332 Muscat-Dubai is rather old but who cares for a 45-minute hop, but service is still very good. I also had a free upgrade to First to go with one from Manchester to Dubai on the outward journey, so I guess that increases the feel good factor! The leg to Manchester on an A380 was perfect. The cabin crew were good , service was efficient. A good meal, an entertaining movie, a couple of hours sleep before a light snack and then chauffeur service to get me home.\",\n",

When we arrived at the airport we were greeted by friendly check in assistant - we had no reserved seats like we had asked for at booking and they changed our seats with no hassle. Onboard the seats were comfortable and inflight entertainment up to a fairly standard quality although some of the selection was a little sparse. Abu Dhabi airport was not one of the most pleasant airports I have been through. On the next stretch of the flight there were issues in that the food service seemed unorganised and random with people sat right next to me getting served 30 minutes before I was and there seemed to be no system in place. The aircraft clean and modern. On the stretch back the service was spotty again.  Overall the flight was very good although not without its problems.',\n",

The aircraft was parked next to an air bridge that wasn't attached to it. The buy-on-board food didn't really seem to excite anyone (LCCs seem to have better sales). I was in row 6 on the way out and it was fine (I think they can move the curtain to make this a business class seat) but on the second leg in row 10, I didn't have enough space to put my laptop out in a way that I could type on it. This means that paying a little extra would be worth it to get those extra couple of hours of work in. Also, Orly is quite a miserable airport (they don't fly from Paris CDG) but Madrid T4 is nice and modern.\",\n",

The flight crew only came through the cabin 3 times in a 10 hour flight. First serving pre order breakfast followed by beverage service. Five hours later for pre order lunch followed by snacks or lunch for purchase(if they had enough). Finally 1.5 hours prior to landing for pre order snakes and beverage service. I would also use Web Checkin and look for that queue at the airport. Overall very happy with Jetstar considering their low rates.',\n",

AVOD was a bit tricky to operate and not nearly the number of choices available as on some carriers. The TV offerings were a little weak, the film offerings were a little better. Aircraft was clean and well maintained. The two biggest problems were the AVOD box under several seats in each row, which significantly impacted leg room if it was under the seat in front of you. Also, for some reason the armrests only raised to 45 degrees, making it difficult for a person in a center seat to get up to use the lavatory. Seat pitch a little tight for such a long haul.\",\n",

The flight is by propeller plane (plane itself was dated) and has maybe 20 seats total, and does bus to runway boarding. Overall a very good experience and was the same price, though like 4 hours faster than taking a ferry from Athens so I'd definitely recommend the trip.\",\n",

The meals were excellent and was a bonus to pre-order meals prior to departure. The entertainment system had a good range of films and music. The seats are comfortable with good leg room, however on a long haul flight it is difficult to be really comfortable unless in Business Class.

Check in, both leaving and coming back, was smooth, no issues. Didn't get slapped with any additional fees since we followed all of the instructions on the site. The plane was early/on time both going there and coming back, although other Spirit flights around us were significantly delayed. I guess we got lucky. The plane was clean enough. Didn't bother paying for any snacks or beverages. Not a ton of leg space but not terrible. I'd say that we had a very average flight, but honestly that's all we needed. They got us to and from where we needed to go for a good price. I'd definitely fly again. There are better airlines out there for sure, but you really do get what you pay for in this case.\",\n",

It took LH staff over 30 minutes to resolve, but in the end, I am sitting comfortably onboard. Boarding was efficient and smooth, and my seat (exit row 28L) is perfect. We pushed back 5 minutes ahead of schedule. The cabin crew have been particularly attentive, efficient, and friendly. Beverage and meal service were quick. My only complaint is with the new economy drink and meal service. Although the inflight menu continues to list sparkling wine as available for purchase, the reality is that in economy, champagne is not to be had for love nor money. This is a discrepancy that should be resolved, either by changing the information in the inflight magazine, or preferably, by restoring this purchase option. In any event, I will continue to fly and enjoy United Airlines.\",\n",

ATH-ARN was again great legroom and also served a hot breakfast. For what we pay it is great value, far better than many other competing airlines, the planes are also new and clean. Only drawback is that there is no entertainment provided on the 3 hr flight, why not show a movie?',\n",

The service in premium economy was really what I would have expected in business class, constantly serving drinks and providing service. Amazing value for the money. Brand new in-flight entertainment system on the B777-300ER, same day / night destination time zone synchronization lighting (i.e. blue during the day time at destination) as is found on the new Boeing 787. Bath rooms had extra amenities, wet wipes, deodorants, and hand towels. Beyond my expectations for Premium Economy (which they reffer to as comfort class).',\n",

The flight from LED to SVO had a delay and although we were told that the connecting flight would wait for us as (because of the re-booking) there would be a large group of SXF passengers on board, it did not. But directly upon entering SVO airport a SU representative would hand out pre-printed new boarding passes and a beverage voucher, so no need to go to a transfer desk. I found that quite professional. The aircraft used were in very good shape and we found seats and legroom far superior to most western airlines. Crews were dressed in very attractive uniforms and were quite fluent in English. Alcoholic drinks and a sandwich (even a pre-ordered vegetarian one for my companion) were offered - basic, but hey, that's the way it is nowadays. Small downpoint: the very interestingly looking in-flight magazine was almost exclusively in Russian language. The transfer in SVO (as well as entering Russia in LED) was quick and smooth (performed by traditionally grumpy staff, though). The sparkling airports in LED and SVO but Berlin's SXF trashy airport to shame.

Received help from YVR ground crew since this was my first air travel in Canada. The flight took off and landed on time. Cabin crew on board was good at communication and drinks were served. However no meal was served for a 5-hr flight, which was to my surprise (and then I knew that AC simply does not do that on domestic flights no matter short-haul or long-haul). En-route entertainment system was a nice touch and there were programmes for different ages and culture. Seat was not an issue since I was seated in an exit row. Second segment from YUL to YHZ was on an E190, which was one of the most comfortable single-aisle aircraft in my opinion. Had entertainment system as well. Also, only drinks were served. This time I was seated in a normal row and the seat pitch was just enough to accomodate myself (6\\'2\" and 240lbs). Third segment was also a short one from YHZ to YQY, operated by Jazz on a 30 years old DeHavilland DHC8-100 (Dash8) turboprop. Cabin attendant was friendly and served drinks and snacks. Seat pitch was even tighter this time but since the seat cushion was shortened, there was still enough room to seat myself.

The flight to San Francisco was OK except for the fact that by the time that the FA got to be he said that he was all out of meat, fish, and chicken and the only thing he had left was pasta. I am on a low carb diet so I ate very little. In fact, he told me that I should eat salad. On the flight from Los Angeles, there were sufficient meals so that I had my choice. The FA here was very pleasant and accommodating.

As the aircraft was not fitted out with the most recent business class seats, the seats still were angled and would not get fully flat but were comfortable enough. One negative point: there was no screen to provide privacy in case you sit next to a stranger.

As others mentioned before, there is no real decline and the seat cushions were worn out which led us to use the cushions handed out to make sitting a little bit more comfortable. Good quality amenity kits were handed out. Food and drinks: after champagne for aperitif, designated Premium Economy menu cards were handed out. We were served the main cabin economy lunch, but on a different tray. The food was among the best we have had in economy both quality and quantity wise. It was accompanied by wine which was presented restaurant style in a real glass. Digestifs were followed by a cornet filled with sweets. Before landing, a yummy pizza pocket was served. Fight attendants were always approachable, friendly and courteous. We would book AF's premium economy again whenever possible, especially because of the fixed shell seat and great food.\",\n",

       " 'A nice trip with China Southern Airlines. The service, food and wine was the best from guangzhou to LA, and both my wife and I were really impressed. On the flight from Guangzhou I slept most of the way but everyone was friendly and the A380 was very comfortable. Spotlessly clean and a great flight. ',\n",

       " 'Im a frequent flyer and Ive tried many airlines on the way to India and back. I have to say that Emirates is simply the best one. Great prices, good transit airport at Dubai (ok, sometimes little bit crowded), really nice staff, good food and good connections. ',\n",
       " 'Flew from London to Jeddah, good flight, the one from London was empty, the food was excellent, seats good and crew polite. The flight from Dubai to Jeddah was however really full, nevertheless service very good and they gave hot towels in economy. The entertainment system remote was touch screen from London though not from Dubai. Great inflight entertainment though. WiFi is slow and very limited.',\n",
       " 'ZRH-DXB and return on A380 which is a pleasure to fly as it give a little feeling of space in economy. Good seat width and very quite aircraft. Good service and food though not as good as the best asian airlines. Great IFE. 4 flights on Emirates and everything went fine. But the B777 in 3-4-3 should be avoided when possible.',\n",
       " \"Arrived Early at Manila Airport. Airline Security were friendly and accommodating. Only Few counters were opened. one for One world, one for J-class and 2 for Y-class, which makes the queue waiting time longer. Staff were friendly too. The plane was newly refurbished B767 Sky Suite with added leg space and bigger LCD monitor. Food was ok, didn't know that there is only one menu choice on board.\",\n",
       " \"Flew from Zhengzhou CGO to Incheon ICN and then Vancouver YVR. Received decent ground service at CGO, no waiting at the check-in counter and customer check, aircraft was a newly decorated 737-800. Main course meal served inflight and was a surprise since it was a morning short-haul flight. Flight was on time both for takeoff and landing. Have to say that the landing was terrible, hard and banked. Int'l connection at ICN was smooth and did not take more than 30 minutes. Korean Air staff was available during transfer. The flight to YVR was at that time a 747-400, which was aged but carefully maintained. Cabin was cold for me but extra blankets were available. Provided toothbrush kit and slippers even for economy class. Cabin crew was not good enough at English but well enough to provide services. Two meals were served and both were good. The flight itself was on time and the captain was of great professionalism, communication with cabin was made after takeoff and before landing in Korean and English, which was a nice touch especially on Asian carriers. In-flight entertainment system was available on both segments. Did not use much because the touch screen was aged and its reaction was slow. Overall very satisfied, however the fare was a bit too high, so I will give 9 out of 10.\",\n",
       " \"I was very pleased with the service provided. We paid 짙420 return which was a bargain. Nice new planes, big individual TV's, good food, plenty of drinks and good seat pitch. The layout of 2x4x2 is good if you are a couple and can get the window seats. Oman airport is not the best but it was a short stop so didn't really matter to us. My only gripes are the toilets were not the cleanest and one or two of flight attendants let the service down, but overall I thought it was great value for money and would definitely fly with them again.\",\n",

       " 'First time traveller on Qatar Airways. We travelled in the business class cabin and as a frequent business class BA flyer I was amazed! It was much better than British Airways and cheaper! The seats are very comfortable with plenty of space and storage space. The TV was big and HD. The choice of films, TV, games and music is very good. The food choice and quality was really good. It was middle eastern based and included appetisers, starters, mains, deserts and a choice of breads. All in all we were so impressed. the stewardesses were attentive, polite and efficient. We will definitely be flying Qatar Airways again!',\n",
       " 'Flew 5 June and back from CPH on 13 June routing HAN-BKK-DOH-CPH-DOH-BKK. HAN-BKK in B777-200. BKK-DOH in A380. DOH-CPH in B787. Excellent experience throughout. All flights on time. Staff alert, attentive and productive. Service and drinks world top class. Food amount and quality is significantly slipping but still acceptable. Because QR has recently done a lot of promotional sales, business class cabins are now full or almost full. However, service was still exhibited well and focused. I rate the B777-200 business class seat and cabin comfort high. However, the best seat and cabin among the 3 aircrafts tried was the A380: almost noiseless and with the luxury bar on the upper deck. FA tend not to chat with each other and keep themselves busy making a true effort comforting the pax ??they are friendly and talk positively with most passengers. That?셲 the way! Of all sectors above only the DOH-CPH was in economy, of course a different ballgame with a slimmer hardware and software - but altogether the rating became equally high. Worst on the 787 is the extreme compacted seating which must be among the heaviest packed economy in the world ??not much dreaming on that part of the Dreamliner, now I understand the nickname ?쏯ightmare-liner?? If the person in front of you reclines you are forced to do the same unless you close your tray-table! In contrast, the following sector back from CPH-DOH was in the Dreamliner aircraft?셲 business class which offered a superb odysse, but still a bit below that of QR?셲 A380. Business class full but staff managed very well, high degree of attention and service. Al Mourjan lounge in DOH clearly 5 star, though too big to my taste. Lots of food in either buffets, a la carte. The bar on 1st floor offered 3 different, prestigious champagnes (I just checked and saw the bottles). From DOH-BKK in A380: faultless, quiet, lots of service and talkative FA?셲. I could have all 3 options of hot meals, but limited myself to vegetarian and chicken. Quality of food deteriorates a bit. Slept well. Ground-staff assisted me catching my next flight on a difficult time-constrained connection by a Low Cost Carrier, though actually not QR?셲 problem. Thanks, QR!',\n",
       " \"Some of the reviews about Spirit baffle me: Much of the criticism seems to center on Spirit charging for everything other than getting you to your destination. I don't know if these people have been living under a rock or what, but everything Spirit charges extra for is clearly explained on their website. I have flown Spirit twice\\r\\nnow, once from CLE to DFW, and once from CLE to LAS. Three of the four flights were on time, the fourth was delayed by about an hour. The Airbus A320 fleet - the only plane Spirit flies - is one of the newest in the industry. The interior was as clean as any other U.S. airline, though I admit that's a pretty low bar. For the most part, the crew was professional. At this price point, all you really can expect is a seat on a jet to get you from point A to point B. That's all, nothing more. And Spirit generally delivered on that promise. This is not to suggest that flying Spirit is for everyone: The seats are very thin, and if the person behind you decides to move his or her table tray around, it feels like someone is thrusting their knuckle - two knuckles - into your back. There is no curbside check-in. And because Spirit has no reciprocity with other airlines, if your flight is cancelled or suffers a long delay, you are stuck until Spirit can get you there, which may be 24 hours or more. But fortunately, I experienced none of these problems. If you read their website and can live with Spirit's scaled-down way of doing business, you stand a good chance of traveling for significantly cheaper than on any other U.S. airline.\",\n",
       " \"Since they offered a very low fare and being the only direct flight to CMB from FCO, I decided to give them another chance. It's an A330-200 with completely refurbished cabin with very spacious legroom. IFE - quite an impressive collection with very good LED screens. Food is excellent. Two main meals served with a premium collection of vines. Staff is always smiling and attending. Always ready to help you. A very clean wash room with lots of amenities. It's an impressive improvement for the airline within just three years. A truely five star service. \",\n",
       " 'Flew to Lanzarote (TOM7414) and (TOM7415) from EMA to ACE, 10th July 2014. Modern fleet of 737, 757, 767 and 787 aircraft for both short and long haul flights. Customer service is excellent and in-flight eatery menu is very good! Staff on-board and in the airport are more smartly dressed and provide an excellent service. ',\n",
       " 'Flight was from Beijing to Kiev on their 767 in Premium Economy Class. We left on time at 01.35 hrs and arrived into KBP on time. Flight was full in Economy and just a few empty seats in Premium Economy. There were a lot of Chinese on board and announcements were also made in Mandarin by one of the cabin crew. The service was good and a Dinner (almost too much food for the time of night) and Breakfast was served. Both were tasty. Plenty of drinks also for those that wanted them during the flight. IFE was pretty poor but then I slept. Better seats and more leg room in Premium Economy in comparison to Economy. Overall a nice flight. ',\n",
       " '5/6/15, DEN-GRR, A320, First Class, seat 1F.  Was meant to be an AA with BA Avios points, flight however it was delayed and would have meant missing a connecting flight so was put onto this direct flight.  Seat was very comfortable with plenty of width and legroom.  No Pre departure drink offered and crew were not that friendly, though attentive, chewing gum the whole time which I think looks very unprofessional.  Drinks topped up regularly through the flight.  Meal was excellent also. No entertainment was provided.  Arrived on time.',\n",
       " 'After reading many reviews about this airline I had a few concerns. I booked with Flight Center and was having a few issues with them about my flights. I called Vietnam Customer Service in Sydney Australia and they soon put everything right. Check in was smooth with fast track priority. The new business class lounge was excellent, had a nice foot massage. Once onboard we were warmly greeted by the crew - refreshing hand towels and champagne. Food was good, drinks were plentiful. Nothing was any trouble for the crew their English was excellent. As it was a long stopover we were taken to a hotel which was an excellent chance to shower, rest and have a meal. Ok so they are not in the same class as Emirates etc and I have flown them but for the price that you pay their service is excellent.',\n",
       " 'MEL-SYD return and multiple flights. Once again this airline is as good as they come. Flew business class between Melbourne and Wellington recently and was more than impressed with the quality of the food and service. Lounges for Trans-Tasman flights are shared with Air New Zealand which are both very good in Melbourne and Wellington. Recent trips to Sydney and return have also been impressive. Nice apple muffin served and water, juice tea or coffee offered and due to Platinum status seating in row 3 a bonus. The other thing about VA is their turn-around time which is pretty quick. Often seated at Departure gate and watch passengers disembarking and in what seems no time at all you are being boarded for your flight. Staff are always friendly and helpful. Overall an airline that is really striving for excellence. ',\n",
       " \"Again it was a joy to use the airlines Premium Economy cabin. It's a pity that other airlines do not follow Air New Zealand's lead in this product. The crew were brilliant as was the food. Will always choose this airline against others because of this product\",\n",
       " \"Allegiant Air is a discount airline and as such all extras will cost extra to keep the ticket price low. So if you can travel with just a small back pack sized carry on you won't pay for bags but otherwise any larger size bag is going to cost extra. Drinks and snacks on the plane will cost extra, but you can bring your own snacks for free of course if you think ahead. Seats are not as comfortable as a United or larger carrier, they don't recline and they aren't as cushy. But the upside is that my flight was a direct flight and the price was super low. I think it was $65 one way or something ridiculous like that, not even on sale. Staff were friendly, and I had no issues whatsoever.\",\n",
       " 'First trip on the reconfigured B777 business class and I was impressed. Virtually identical to the CX layout, which I love. Quite a bit of privacy and personal space, with a very comfortable flat bed. IFE had ample choices, and the food and beverage was good as well. In flight overseas WiFi worked very well also. Flagship check in at LHR in a separate and dedicated building makes the process very easy. I think AA has upped their game on the overseas routes - perhaps not all - but this was an excellent trip.',\n",
       " \"First overseas trip in the newly configured B767 with flat beds. The cabin looks very crisp, clean, and modern but I found the seats to be uncomfortable and poorly designed. The seats seem very narrow, and once in the flat bed position your feet end up in a narrow, confining box-like area which makes it difficult to move around. Impacted sleep quality immensely. Tablet-based IFE strange, clunky with limited choices. The biggest positive surprise was the food, which was as good an airline meal as I've had. Perfectly roasted duck breast in a coconut lime curry was restaurant quality, salads fresh and crisp. On balance better than expected and an improvement for AA.\",\n",
       " 'Azul operates this route with ATR 72-600. The aircraft was new, comfortable and safe. The pitch is good and has a leather seat. The crew is friendly and professional. Azul service has free soda, juice, water and snacks for free aboard. The round-trip flights were on time.',\n",

Efficient but not friendly. The purser seemed to spend a lot if time scanning passengers and was even individually telling people off for not obeying the seatbelt sign long after the turbulence had passed. With crew it is luck and maybe they were having a bad day but for me this one experience has affected my image of the carrier.',\n",
       " 'LAX-HKG, CX 885. Food was good as I had ordered a special meal. Inflight entertainment was good. I was really impressed with the economy seat. I am tall and I have seen lot of issues with seats in economy. On this journey I had taken an aisle seat and it was really spacious and I could stretch my legs out well. HKG-HYD - CX 649. Not as good when compared to my first leg journey. It was on an A330-300, I found the seating was poorer on this leg along with the food as well.',\n",

The boarding process was well organized - SB ticket holders first on bus and first off to enter aircraft at remote stand in Geneva. Aware that Easyjet have changed there hand luggage allowance but no passengers had their hand luggage checked or measured etc. Some taking on board alot more than allowed. A very quick food and beverage service for 45 minute flight. Flight attendants x4 working hard in short flight. No inflight entertainment as expected. Arrival in Nice to the gate safely.',\n",

IFE great. 4 flights on Emirates and everything went fine. But the B777 in 3-4-3 should be avoided when possible.',\n",
       " \"I had not flown Gulf for many years, their business class was old and tired, and had 160 degree angled seats, which I find very uncomfortable. I had read many reviews regarding their new Falcon Gold business class, and at a really super price return Bangkok-London, I gave them a second chance. Lounge was nice, security at Bahrain was fast, lounge again very nice. The cabin was a breath of fresh air compared to before, lie flat seats, good food, free flowing wine, I enjoyed the experience. Inflight movie selection was ok, but small selection. It's not Emirates A380, or Emirates lounges, but at 40% less in price, they have my business as long as they don't get expensive again.\",\n",

Checked in with my mobile phone in EWR, unfortunately the TSA couldn?셳 read the ticket so I had to go back to the Check in counter to get the boarding pass. Flight was on time and the crew was very friendly. Got an emergency exit seat during check in for free, so I had enough space but the standard Economy seats looked like they have good pitch. The only thing I couldn't deal with was the mood light, but I don쨈t like it on any airline. I just prefer a dark cabin during flight. Boarding the first flight everyone got a bottle of water, which was refilled during the trip, the crew offered drinks a few times during both legs. Food was for purchase and rather expensive but booking on the airline?셲 web site I knew that before so I had a nice dinner at EWR and bought some chips for the second leg to MUC. KEF is a very small and pleasant airport for transit. From the moment of disembarking to my connection flight I needed less than 10 minutes. I will definitively fly Icelandair again in the future, yet the planes are good and the two crews that attended my flights were excellent. And with 380 EUR the price was more than good.\",\n",
       " \"A very comfortable well run flight. Excellent aircraft. Very good attentive service. Food and wine good choice and well presented. All flights arrived on time. Shame seats don't go completely flat but they do recline sufficiently to enable you to get some sleep.\",\n",
       " 'This time going back to MNL from NRT. Easy check in. No long queue. friendly ground staff too. Smooth boarding process. Food was ok, again, no selection of food on board. the Cabin crew were always busy and non stop in offering drinks and safety reminders such is fastening seatbelt and will be a minor turbulence shortly. The only time they rested was during take off and Landing. Will take this airline again in the future.',\n",
       " \"Flight left Brisbane around 45 minutes late, but arrived ahead of schedule. The only reviews where people complain are the ones who don't pre-book meals, entertainment etc. We had added bags, meals, entertainment and comfort packs when booking and it was like flying a full service airline. We paid for 2 people return what 1 person would cost on Hawaiian Airlines so cannot complain. Jetstar are not a terrible airline you just get what you pay for.\",\n",
       " \"As I looked to book a flight from JFK to Copenhagen, I came across Norwegian and noticed that they were about $250 cheaper than the next leading airline, and offered a direct flight when the next expensive flight involved a brief connection. I came across some pretty negative reviews online and was apprehensive going into the flight. However, I must say that the flight far surpassed my expectations and I will be very likely to fly Norwegian again. I knew going into the flight that Norwegian does not offer complementary beverages or an in-flight meal without a hefty price, so I just made sure to grab a bite and bottle of water at JFK right before my flight and to pack my own little travel pillow (again, for $250 and a couple hours of layover saved by flying Norwegian, I can drop $10 on a sandwich before the flight and not starve, it is well worth it!). The flight was 20 minutes late boarding, though we actually arrived in Copenhagen on time. The flight itself was extremely comfortable. We boarded to music playing, they dimmed the lights quickly after take off, the cabin was pressurized at a lower altitude than most aircrafts are capable of which left me with very little jetlag, free and relatively fast wifi, and each seat was comfortable with it's own personal Android operating screen that contained several good movies & music albums to keep me entertained. All together it was a great flight experience and very impressive for the price, and one that I'd definitely recommend to others.\",\n",
       " 'Flew ZRH-CGK via DOH return onboard B787 and B77W. 3 out of 4 flights arriving/departing DOH were using busses instead of Aerobridge. Not so good for the huge new Hamad International Airport. Meals were all delicious but could be improved in term of quantity. Entertainment onboard were nice, responsive and easy to navigate (It surely great for Indian pax, as it has a lot of Indian contents!). Inflight connectivity works. Cabin service were superb. Crew were genuinly friendly and efficient on all 4 flights! For the price I paid, I will definetly choose Qatar Airways again in the future. ',\n",
       " 'The first time I flew with Qatar Airways.  The aircraft was new, with a great entertainment system, big screen in each seat, many options of movies, series, tv shows, musics, etc. The seat had a good pitch and it was comfortable to sleep. The service aboard was relaxed and very good. Some attendants were serious and unfriendly and we had many interruptions with cabin calls and advertising, it stopped the movie I was watching many times. I will fly with Qatar Airways more times for certain.',\n",
       " \"I'd never normally fly with someone like Thomas Cook but only did so because very few low-cost airlines go to Tunisia. Their website seems quite long-winded but would recommend doing on-line check-in as essentially jumped the queue at the airport desk. Reserved seating was horrifically expensive but we did it anyway. Unfortunately we had one of the older A321's both ways so the cabin was looking a bit old and tired but adequate for a 2hr 40min flight but on the plus side cabin crew were very friendly. Didn't bother with in-flight meals but good enough selection of drinks and snacks, and averagely priced as airlines go. Both the outbound and inbound flights were on time which was a bonus as have heard bad things about Thomas Cook's flight punctuality. Would fly them again but probably only if I had to as they're no better than the low-cost carriers who even with the extras are considerably cheaper.\",\n",
       " 'United recently revamped their Economy food and beverage service on international flights. As much as I\\'ve ripped on United for flights to and from Japan (especially compared to their codeshare partner, ANA), the new system is a definite improvement. Beer and wine are once again complimentary (finally!), and the meal is doled out in three smaller \"courses\" instead of being dumped on your tiny tray table in one go. The food itself (cheese ravioli) wasn\\'t bad at all, again much improved from my last trans-Pacific last year. It\\'s a US airline, so you still have to deal with the occasional long-tenured yet disgruntled flight attendant, but overall I didn\\'t hate the experience, which is saying a lot for a 12 hour flight in Economy on any airline. This review sounds kind of mediocre, but the thing is, the flight was also very cheap. With that in mind, the cost performance was impressive.',\n",

On June 2nd we heard from our youngest daughter that she had been admitted to hospital. We drove to our closest major centre for airline travel which was Calgary. We arrived at the ticketing agent at about 1.50 pm and the agent on hearing our situation took things in control, calling the gate to say that she was sending a passenger who needed to get on their flight that was boarding in 20 minutes. She processed my ticket, waved extra baggage costs and put me into a premium seat so I could disembark quickly. I made the flight and arrived home in time to talk to our daughter before the night was out. I/we will will definitely fly Westjet in the future. ',\n",

Throughout (I think so far 7 trips with them), they have never had any delays with me, and even if there has been, it would be a maximum 30 minutes (and still be able to arrive in Muscat on time). Staff are professional, yet friendly enough to chat to. It would be excellent if there was a flight from Muscat to Abu Dhabi at an earlier time (the only ones available now is one that arrives at midnight). The only downside to this airline is that the Highlife shopping is not available for that Abu Dhabi - Muscat due to the short duration, even if you booked and paid for the items online and were hoping for an onboard delivery.',\n",

The outbound flight was on a nicely retrofitted 777 with comfortable spacious chairs and excellent, clear and larger IFE screen. The screens on this 747 were tiny and and very poor resolution by comparison. Nevertheless, the service was usual good BA standard: courteous and efficient, with decent enough food (better than in past years, when revolting soggy pasta seemed to be the norm).
